Finding Usage Patterns for Bots &amp; Suspicious Users From Raw Logs Using Map Reduce,Dhruv Kalaan (~dhruv),"23 Mar, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/finding-usage-patterns-for-bots-suspicious-users-from-raw-logs-using-map-reduce~dyoVa/,Intermediate,Talks,Security,"22 Jul 2016, 12:31",12,"Anomaly detection and usage patterns of specific users is a major cause of concern for a e-commerce website, and with scrapping affecting live-traffic to the tunes of affecting performance to almost 90%, it has become a prime focus area in the world of security.Standard web application firewalls can help detect these Bots, but only basis of predefined rules/rates.Using map/reduce and analyzing access logs, we try to analyze behavioral patterns of a user and address them as bots, or a suspicious user and throw alerts for the same.Framework is divided into 2 parts-1. Data Acquisition and Log Parsing2. Machine learning and training model for anomaly findingPart 1 Talking about simply plugging in and hooking up logs from various systems into our system, parsing them to get required enrichment fields.Part 2Feeding these logs into spark for machine learning, providing training sets of good/bad data and making use cases basis of user requirement. We would be briefly talking about the architecture, and then moving onto show casing some use cases, and showing the plug-ability of new use cases. Our idea is to have this completely framework driven, where logs can simply be achieved by setting up a listener via fluent. Even Machine learning use cases have been made completely configurable where we can simply plugin any use case basis of config files and driver driven machine learning codes. So designing a use case won't take more than 10-15 minutes.Since rule based detection and alerting any web application firewall can do we have moved away from rule based anomaly detection and letting the system learn itself basis of machine learning algorithms and thereby producing anomalies which would mean, any deviation from normal behavior rather than only certain rule based triggering, which any web application firewall would do.We would be ending off, by providing challenges faced during our journey and how we overcame those issues, throughput that we have seen in our system, and our ideal response time to take care of any anomaly.Our goal, helping a tech driven company like Makemytrip to quickly identify any anomalies that have occurred in the least amount of time, thereby boosting business.",Basic Python KnowledgeUnderstanding of Logstash/Syslog-NgSpark/PysparkKafkaELK Basic Machine Learning understanding,"Link to Elast-Alert = https//github.com/yelp/elastalert Link to Elastic Search = https//github.com/elastic/elasticsearch Link to Kibana = https//github.com/elastic/kibanaLink to Spark - http//spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.htmlLink to Kafka - http//kafka.apache.org/documentation.htmlLink to Fluentd - http//www.fluentd.org/Python Libraries used -1.

We will present the current status of development, how things areimplemented internally, why we chose C++, benchmarks, and examples of usagefrom Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and Julia.The Detailed AbstractMotivationSymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While SymPyturns out to be very useful for many applications, one of the long termproblems with SymPy is that the speed might be insufficient when handling ofvery large expressions is required. Another problem with SymPy is that due tobeing written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use from other languages likeJulia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python to Juliabridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additionaloverhead.MethodsFor these reasons, we implemented SymEngine, an open source C++ symbolicmanipulation library, with the goal of being the fastest library for symbolicmanipulation (opensource or commercial), and allowing natural wrappers to otherlanguages like Python (the most mature wrapper), Ruby, Julia and others.ResultsWe will show benchmarks against other computer algebra systems (opensource andcommercial) as well as examples of usage from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby andJulia. We will present a roadmap how to port SymPy on top of SymEngine.We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the codecannot have an undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease ofdevelopment as one is used to from Python).The SymEngine C++ library already has 36 contributors, 109 forks and 146 starson GitHub, as of June 30, 2016.ConclusionSymEngine should fix the slowness of SymPy, while providing a familiarinterface, and at the same allowing many languages to naturaly use it, thuscreating a common platform/tool that many projects (like SymPy, Sage, ...) canuse as their main symbolic engine and all contribute back to it.","Nothing as such, basic math to appreciate examples preferred.",ResourcesContents of presentation prepared by the SymEngine team lies here https//github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/SymEngine C++ library https//github.com/symengine/symengineSymEngine Python wrappers (with SymPy and Sage integration) https//github.com/symengine/symengine.pySymEngine Ruby wrappers https//github.com/symengine/symengine.rbSymEngine Julia wrappers https//github.com/symengine/symengine.jlSymPy http//sympy.org/,"Sumith is currently a third year computer science undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.

It came to life after a successful Kick-starter campaign by Damien George. CircuitPython is a fork of MicroPython further developed by Adafruit Industries(https//www.adafruit.com) which includes great extension to control analog sensors, RGB and neopixel LEDs etc.Traditionally Microcontrollers like AVR, ARM, ESP8266(WiFi SoC) are programmed in Embedded C or Assembly which has a quite overwhelming learning curve, MicroPython makes it easy and allows you to do same with your favourite scripting language Python. Imagine you want to read a sensor or turn on lights from a web server, now you don't need to learn register level programming for that, you can do that with MicroPython, It is also supported on 5$ WiFi SoC, the ESP8266 which is great for making small IoT devices.MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately, along with the ability to run and import scripts from the built-in filesystem.

OLMONK helps one avoid them, and enables smooth data analysis and visualization.The package can be used as a validation layer before any kind of data analysis software. While building a software, the developer can import OLMONK and can define constraints depending on the required input format. The package then logs appropriate warnings and errors, along with data location (i.e. row and column info), in a file, and notifies the user of the same. While most of the standard inconsistencies can be rectified by OLMONK, some cases may require human intervention and for them the package raises errors. It allows the user to ensure the correctness of data, before feeding the analysis tool with potentially incompatible data. One can validate different kinds of data with tailor-made checks. It can currently process .csv, .txt, .xlsx, .bed format files.

Cyber Security on IoT introduces some significant challengesData collected are very sensitive. Most of the times they capture personal data and/or business critical data. Privacy is very importantEach device generates data at scale. But the device has constraints on memory, computation and battery life. Connecting each device to the cloud reduces the life of the device.This calls for a new paradigm in Machine Learning that exhibits the following featuresData should not be moved out of the device and/or networkThe Machine Learning models should be privacy-preservingAnomaly detection is a class of unsupervised machine learning models that identifies anomalies in network data. In cybersecurity, anomalies are flagged as a potential threat. In this talk, the speaker discusses how to build anomaly detection models for IoT that satisfies the above two features.Federated learning is a family of Machine Learning algorithms that has the core idea a connected network exists in which there is a central server node. Each of the nodes creates data - that has to be used for training as well as for prediction. Each of the nodes trains a local model and only that model is shared with the server, not the data. But a man-in-the-middle attack can siphon off the data. How to address this? This is done using encryption. The data from the edge node can only be decrypted by the central node.How will this be privacy preserving if all this does is decentralized learning and encryption? The third and final step to achieve truly privacy-preserving machine learning is to use differential privacy. A common approach to achieve differential privacy is to add random noise to the data before training. The speaker will discuss how to do local and global differential privacy.In summary, Federated learning enables Edge devices to collaboratively learn a machine learning model but keeping all of the data on the device itself. Federated Learning gives the following advantagesLow latencyPrivacy-PreservingEnergy EfficientIn this talk, the speaker talks how to build anomaly detection models using federated learning on tensorflow. The speaker shows hows to build custom algorithms and loss functions. The inference is done using uTensor - a light weight AI inference library based on mbed and TensorFlow.

They form a rich and powerful part of the core Python language, and a working knowledge of how to use them will serve as an indispensable tool for every Python programmer.ObjectiveThe first part of the talk aims to provide a conceptual understanding of what generators are, how to make them in Python, and how to use them to make your code more efficient and sleek. The second part focuses on understanding how they form the core foundation of concurrency in Python.The talk will begin with an introduction of the yield keyword, and how to create generators with it. This will be followed by showing how they can be used for lazy iteration and saving memory. A brief example in a real world application related to data loading in machine learning will also be presented. The next part will focus on the ability of the yield statement to accept values, and will explain how this can be used to make stateful functions with minimal and elegant code. The yield from keyword will be introduced and the particularly mind-bending example of binary tree traversal will be used to showcase its power.The next part will point out important differences between yield from and the yield keyword. We will then use it to create co-routines - functions that can transfer control between each other mid-execution.A subtle and important distinction between parallelism and concurrency will be highlighted with a simple example through co-routines built using yield from.The concept of an event loop will also be introduced through this example.The talk will conclude with a discussion of the async and await keywords, and how the asyncio library can be used to streamline writing concurrent Python code.Target audienceBeginners who are familiar with the basics of Python.

Eventually, we will look at simulating a large number of such games and see if there are any interesting strategies that can be developed, looking at the results of the simulations or it's just that it's random. We'll look at one such solution that uses Python standard library alone, with no external dependencies. DescriptionFrom WikipediaPoker is a family of card games that combines gambling, strategy, and skill. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or ""community"" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures.Thus, poker is a very candidate for understanding how one can run a large number of random simulations. Target AudienceThose interested in a game of Poker and Python - for the fun part of solving a problem in Python. This talk should be a good introduction to using some features from standard library to Python programmers who are new to Python. There might be something for more experienced Python programmers as well. People who are interested in understanding how to simulate certain real world scenarios, might also find the talk useful.Talk OutlineThe talk will cover following main topics. Most of the talk will walk through the code. A quick overview of poker hands and how they are ranked. This section should demonstrates the power of Python's built-ins like set, sorted which makes solution to the problem of ranking Poker hands a very compact one, deriving inspiration from Peter Norvig's solution. (approx 10-15 mins).Next we look at what one Poker Game looks like and model it. Here we model a Poker Table with 'n' players and different stages of a poker game. This demonstrates modules from Python's standard library random, itertools and collections.  (approx 5-7 mins) Finally we look at How can we answer questions by running simulations of such Poker games. List comprehensions etc. (approx 5-7 mins) What percentage 'flop' winners end up being final game winners?Is Ace High during initial deal - really a good hand that can win?What about starting with a Pair?What about starting with same suit?","Although there are no prerequisites for this specific talk.

Over 483 people died due to the flooding caused by the opening of dams and a million people were evacuated.I started a website (keralarescue.in), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives.The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on.The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks.The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.AudienceThis talk is open to all levels of expertise. Beginners would be inspired to explore the field better to equip themselves at times of need. Intermediate listeners will appreciate the python based technology stack used.

Introduction to Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian methods using PyMC3,MukulJoshi,"01 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/introduction-to-probabilistic-programming-and-bayesian-methods-using-pymc3~dRz0d/,Advanced,Talks,Scientific Computing,"01 Jul 2019, 20:51",NA,"Bayesian inference has been popular in scientific research for a long time. Using this statistical technique, we state prior beliefs about what we think our data looks like to encode expert knowledge into a model. These prior beliefs are then updated in light of new data, providing not one prediction, but a full distribution of likely answers.Bayesian methods lack widespread commercial use because they are tough to implement. But probabilistic programming reduces what significantly. While normal programming languages denote procedures, probabilistic programming languages denote models and perform inference on these models. Users write code to specify a model for their data, and the languages run sampling algorithms across probability distributions to output answers with confidence rates and levels of uncertainty across a full distribution. Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two added constructs (1) the ability to draw values at random from distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program via observations. (Ref Gordon et. al. 2014) PyMC3 is a probabilistic programming package for Python that allows users to fit Bayesian models using a variety of numerical methods.

Currently, malaria is identified by taking a blood smear of the patient, staining it to expose the parasite and then careful observation under the microscope which requires a skilled professional. Today, India has 1 doctor per 10,000. The WHO recommends 1 per 1000. Given such dearth of skilled professional we lose many lives because of delayed diagnosis. How can Python Help in Detection of Malaria?In this talk, I’d like to discuss an alternative solution to diagnosing malaria. We use artificial intelligence, precisely Deep Learning, to classify a blood smear of patient as infected or not.

"Curve fitting using Python: LavenbergMarquardt Algorithm, numpy and matplotlib.",Suyog7130,"01 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/curve-fitting-using-python-lavenbergmarquardt-algorithm-numpy-and-matplotlib~dwBmb/,Intermediate,Talks,Scientific Computing,"01 Jul 2019, 23:47",NA,"Python libraries like numpy and scipy have many great functionalities that are routinely used by researchers all over the world for their computational needs. This present work is part of a similar research that I did in the first half of 2019. The research is titled 'Finding Evidence of Waldmeier Effect in Sun-like Stars'. And it principally is a data analysis project relying heavily on computer routines written in Python. So, first of all, what is the Waldmeier Effect (WE)? It is widely known that stars like our Sun have strong magnetic field and that this field varies periodically with time. Now, it has been extensively studied for Solar Magnetic Cycles that the stronger cycles rise faster. This is known as the Waldmeier Effect. Our work is focused on finding the evidence of existence of the Waldmeier Effect in other stars. One of the prime motivations behind this is that if it can showed, even preliminarily, that some characteristic features of the Solar Cycle are visible in other stellar magnetic cycles as well, then it could be possible that the same dynamo mechanism operates in these stars. Now, the original raw data is very irregular owing to rotations of the star and uneven observations. Thus, the original data in itself cannot be used for the analysis. So, we fit some appropriate profiles to the raw data. Now, since this fitting has to be done for each cycle separately, we need to isolate the cycles first. This brings us to the start of the actual data analysis part. We bin the raw data with a time interval of one year to get the yearly median values. Then we do a 3-point running average smoothing so get monthly interpolated values in between the yearly medians. Cycles are isolated between two consecutive minima.Based upon previous similar studies with respect to the Sun, we selected two profile functions to fit to the data, namely, the quasi-Planck fit and the skewed-Gaussian fit. And after proper fitting is obtained, we calculate the value of the Rise Rate and process to make a plot.Coming to the Python routines now. We employ the scipy function curve_fit fitting the curves to the raw data. This function uses the trusted region reflective method with the LavenbergMarquardt Algorithm (LMA) to find the best fit parameters. The LMA does this by finding the least sum of squares of deviation from the original value. LMA was first proposed by More et al in 1985. The first heuristic values of the parameters are estimated based upon the interpolated curve. What the LMA does is find the most suited parameter values iteratively. The maximum number of iterations is 1200. Suppose this limit is reached before optimum values are found then we manually change the heuristic values a little and re-run the program.Although the curve_fit function is at the heart of the analysis, numerous other Python libraries and functions are used. Some of these are listed below.julian, datetime, decimal, numpy, scipy.optimize, scipy.interpolate, pandas, pdfkit, math, matplotlib.pyplot.The slides of a presentation that I had the opportunity to give at a recent conference in Nepal are attached below.

Mann-Kendall test and Spearman's Rho test are the two most widely used methods of non-parametric trend detection. Most commonly used non-parametric method like the Mann-Kendall test assumes the data to be serially independent. In the presence of serially correlated data, the tests indicate erroneous results. To address the serial correlation issue, various modifications to the Mann-Kendall test and Spearman's rho test were suggested in literature like Pre-whiteningTrend-free pre-whiteningBias-corrected pre-WhiteningVariance correction approachBlock bootstrapping, etc. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. To arrive at a better consensus, it is suggested to use various methods for testing the trends. There is a huge debate in the scientific community to find the optimal method to estimate correct trends in time-series data.

[HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]To give a bit of background - I built this application for Wikipedia under Outreachy Round 15 (https//www.outreachy.org/). The app summarizes the contributions of the Wikipedia editors and presents it in a CV-like format.

The main reason for this is the demand for industrial scale usage of NNs such as deploying them on mobile devices, storing them efficiently, transmitting them via band-limited channels and most importantly doing inference at scale. A number of papers have been published in last few years, proposing different approaches to minimize the footprints of neural networks. The aim of my talk will be to summarize recent developments and techniques in this field, by quoting benchmarks, algorithms and results from papers. On a superficial level, there are two basic types of compression are Network Pruning and Quantization.Network Pruning[HTML_REMOVED]The motive behind network pruning is to selectively nullify or remove some nodes in order to reduce the size of the NN without losing much accuracy. Not only does this reduce the space required to store the model but also reduces the number of computations for sample. A number of papers in the last 2 years have suggested using Bayesian inferences and Variational Dropout, a probabilistic approach to estimating deterministic weights and selectively pruning some of them after sparsifying respective weight matrices. Quantization[HTML_REMOVED]Conventionally, weights are stored and operations are performed with 32bit floating point numbers but with the rising need for running models on constrained devices, neural networks can be further compressed by either reducing the number of unique weights by clustering or by reducing the number of bits required represent weights, which also adds a regularizing effect, often resulting in higher accuracy than raw models.","Knowledge of Bayes Theorem, Convolution Neural Networks and common Image Classification datasets.",Will add slides later.

Deep Learning with the Scientific Method,Jaidev Deshpande (~jaidev),"10 Jul, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/deep-learning-with-the-scientific-method~dyyPd/,Intermediate,Talks,Data science,"11 Jul 2018, 11:41",9,"The ProblemAs technology becomes cheaper and more available, we start taking it for granted. Nowhere is this more true than inmachine learning. As machines become cheaper and data becomes more and more voluminous, our approach to specificmachine learning problems often, and understandably, becomes haphazard. Since GPUs are much cheaper and more widelyavailable than ever before, we implicitly believe that throwing enough artificial neurons at a problem will eventuallysolve it. While this by itself may be true, it is not uncommon for ML practitioners to realize - unfortunately only inhindsight - that most of the iterations required to build a successful predictive model were unnecessary. Ironically,these 'missteps' are often what lead us to the correct answer. Solving a machine learning problem is like traversing aminefield, where the safest path can only be determined by blowing up a significantly large number of mines. You canonly figure out the right approach after making a bunch of mistakes. Since there is no general rule for determining a'best model', most things in deep learning can only be solved with trial and error. To a large extent, this 'see whatsticks' approach cannot be avoided. However it can be curbed significantly, with a structured approach to runningmachine learning experiments. This structured approach is what this talk is about.The SolutionThe building blocks of neural networks and the science behind them, including that of their efficiency andtrainability, are already very well understood [1]. The heuristics required to ascertain reasonable convergence andpredictive accuracy have also been studied in detail [2]. On a very high level, these best practices are simply aresult of studying and understanding the underlying mathematics of neural networks. However, the lack of a structuredapproach prevents us from fully utilizing these best practices. The ideal way of managing machine learning experiments iswith a lab journal. Each machine learning experiment can be reasonably characterized by a hypothesis, a procedure andfinally drawing inferences from it's results. A well kept journal would help practitioners from repeating mistakes,and narrowing down to the right approach.The ToolsThis talk will introduce a lab journal powered by Python, and optimized for deep learning experiments. It will allowusers to log experiments carried out on sklearn estimators and keras models. The journal also behaves like ahyperparameter grid manager, which also alerts the user if the user accidentally re-runs the same experiment on thesame data with the same parameters. It will have some meta-learning features which allow for an end-to-end approach tomachine learning experiments.[1]. Efficient BackProp[2].

Natural Language Processing is Fun!,Saurabh Deshmukh (~saurabh15),"10 Jul, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/natural-language-processing-is-fun~egN3d/,Intermediate,Talks,Data science,"20 Aug 2018, 12:35",2,"Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. But us humans usually communicate in words, not in tables. Unfortunately we don’t live in this alternate version of history where all data is structured. That’s unfortunate for computers. A lot of information in the world is unstructured — raw text in English or another human language. How can we get a computer to understand unstructured text and extract data from it? Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is the sub-field of AI that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. As long as computers have been around, programmers have been trying to write programs that understand languages like English. The reason is pretty obvious — humans have been writing things down for thousands of years and it would be really helpful if a computer could read and understand all that data.Computers can’t yet truly understand English in the way that humans do — but they can already do a lot! In certain limited areas, what you can do with NLP already seems like magic. You might be able to save a lot of time by applying NLP techniques to your own projects. And even better, the latest advances in NLP are easily accessible through open source Python libraries like spaCy, textacy, and neuralcoref. What you can do with just a few lines of python is amazing.Extracting meaning from text is hard. The process of reading and understanding English is very complex. Doing anything complicated in machine learning usually means building a pipeline. The idea is to break up your problem into very small pieces and then use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately. And that's exactly the strategy we use for NLP.Steps for building a pipelineSentence Segmentation - Break the text apart into separate sentences.Word Tokenization - Break the sentence into separate words.Predicting Parts of Speech for each token - Here, we look at each token and try to guess its part of speech — whether it is a noun, a verb, an adjective and so on.Text Lemmatization -  Figuring out the most basic form or lemma of each word in the sentence.Identifying Stop Words - Words that you might want to filter out before doing any statistical analysis.Dependency Parsing - Figure out how all the words in our sentence relate to each other.Named Entity Recognition (NER) - The goal of Named Entity Recognition, or NER, is to detect and label these nouns with the real-world concepts that they represent.Coreference Resolution - The goal is to figure out this same mapping by tracking pronouns across sentences.Going through thousands of documents and trying to redact all the names by hand could take years.

[HTML_REMOVED]This is one of the questions that has fascinated statisticians and computer scientists for the past five decades.

Yes, it's possible using python's sci-kit library. Mine data, extract features, compute quotients and finally, visualize! Detailed descriptionThe talk will start with an overview of data mining and machine learning concepts, during the course of which common misconceptions about data science would be cleared. As a real life example, the problem statement of job-seekers and recruitment is introduced. This then leads to the solution Vritthi, an open source project and then the technical aspects follow.Vritthi uses data mining and machine learning to help job-seekers to understand their skill sets and take up courses that would help them improve their technical expertise. Vritthi can automatically calculate a professional quotient by collating data from websites like GitHub, StackOverFlow and LinkedIn. This analysis is a result of parsing thousands of similar profiles available through the APIs of the above websites.GitHub archive is one of our data sources which actually helps set standards to coding competencies of individual profiles.Collection of data from GitHub using its API is explained in detail, along with the feature-set used to analyze profiles. Once the data is collected from the API, it passes through the data cleaning phase after which a set of features are extracted. These features could be as simple as number of commits, number of projects in a particular programming language, and so on. Right after this, python sci-kit is used to build the data model that’s required for analysis. A supervised learning model is used which consists of two phases - clustering profiles and computing quotient values. Once the data model is ready, computing technical quotient values per programming language or skill is focused upon. For example, “programming languages used” is one of the attributes of the feature vector. Finally, the computed quotients are visualized using a web application which uses Python’s Bokeh visualization library.Thus, classic data mining and machine learning have been employed on openly available data to solve a specific problem statement.Who is this talk for?Python developers who’d like to explore sci-kitWeb developers who’d like to explore python’s bokeh library for data viz. Entrepreneurs who would like to see how a practical use case is solved using open dataWhat will participants take away?Live example of machine learning and how to adopt python sci-kit library in a ML use caseA solid understanding of data science and how it can solve problems in real lifeDeeper understanding of GitHub’s API for data extraction and mining",Basic programming knowledge in any object-oriented language would be helpful.,Research paper - Vritthi framework for IT recruitment based on machine learning techniques Slides of other talks can be found on Speakerdeck,"Abhiram has been a part of the open source world in Bangalore for over 3 years now.

There are lot of records which can be duplicates or have the same entity references which leads to ambiguity and resource consumption.Entity resolution (ER) is the task of disambiguating records that correspond to real world entities across and within datasets. Problems associated with entity resolution are equally big — as the volume and velocity of data grow, inference across networks and semantic relationships between entities becomes increasingly difficult. Data quality issues, schema variations, and idiosyncratic data collection traditions can all complicate these problems even further. When combined, such challenges amount to a substantial barrier to organizations’ ability to fully understand their data, let alone make effective use of predictive analytics to optimize targeting, thresholding, and resource management.Dedupeit's a modern day python library for entity resolution, which works on machine learning algorithms to perform Deduplication and Record Linkage.","Basic Knowledge of Python and Basics of Machine Learning Classifiers like LR,KNN, DT etc.",https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/19inq4BNUi3U74uIBz-nN7gSVOvtC9S4s-FBW0Im1gUg/edit?usp=sharing,"Vinay is working as a Data Scientist and he loves creating the Data Driven Applications and really love working with the messy data and cleaning it to implement Machine Learning Models to the new age applications.

One aspect of this is ensuring that all code is actually used. There are many reasons for dead code ending up in a project. The most common is refactoring, but another is misspellings, which are only detected at runtime for dynamic languages. Finding and removing dead code allows to keep the code base clean and reduces bugs. This talk is focussed on how we can use Vulture to find dead code. It helps you find unused code in Python programs and it is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested code. Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, Vulture can be a very helpful tool for higher code quality.One part of this talk is to discuss how to automate testing for dead code with Vulture. There are quite a few options availableAdding vulture to your continuous integration testing.A script using the Vulture API for custom tests.Identifying false positives and creating whitelistsVultureBear Integration with coala - a static code analysis tool.This talk is a revised version of a similar talk given at PyCon India 2017 (by the same speaker).",python and pip installedOptional requirementscoalacoala-bears,"The slides accompanying the talk, along with all the examples may be found at RJ722/reducing-dead-code.

Running Tensorflow models on a $35 Device,Soham Chatterjee (~soham48),"09 Jul, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/running-tensorflow-models-on-a-35-device~dGELa/,Advanced,Talks,Embedded python,"09 Jul 2018, 18:29",28,"tl;dr As data becomes increasingly extensive, it becomes important to move your models away from the cloud to where your data is being generated to reduce latency, increase security and save internet bandwidth.  This talk will be about how you can run trained TensorFlow models on Edge devices and how you can use Edge Computing accelerators like the Neural Compute Stick to make your models run even faster.Long VersionThere are a lot of very compelling reasons for shifting computations away from the edge and into the cloud, with the most important being latency issues. Here, latency refers to the time it might take to send data to a server and then receive the response. The few seconds of delay caused by this might not be a problem for your smart home applications, but when in an industry, those few precious seconds, or even microseconds can cause a machine to breakdown or even take lives. Furthermore, many industrial processes might be happening in places where running an internet line may not be possible a mine, for example. And even if having an internet connection is possible, most companies are hesitant to send data over an internet connection and risk exposing their data to hackers prompting them to keep their data in-house. Finally, if you have a lot of sensors, you will probably be streaming data in the order of gigabytes every hour. It does not make sense for companies to pay for the bandwidth to send that much data when most of it will be discarded anyways. Thus it is important to shift all that computation to where the data is being generated.This talk will be about how to move your existing TensorFlow models to Edge devices like Raspberry Pi's. The talk will also introduce other Edge Computing hardware like the Neural Compute Stick to make your models run even faster on Raspberry Pi.Why Attend this talkThis talk will give the audience an understanding of Edge devices and Edge Computing.

Let us suppose the actors are weights and there are rows and rows of TPUs/GPUs behind. The director has assured you that they have rehearsed the play about 10 times, now all you do is pray that the performance goes wellImagine you have 100 different tasks to be performed backstage, but the theatre given to you is really tiny. How will you manage?The answer is by optimizing the tasks. Divide tasks between individuals in such a way that you require less time and space.But how do you manage that with a neural network? How does quantization affect neural computations?When you are dealing with a large amount of data, one has to keep in mind the ever-changing values that one might obtain. Especially, signal data with large SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in them, which causes different sets of data to be produced. The best way to deal with such signal data is to apply truncation or rounding off such values, typically making it a many-to-few mapping. This mapping happens from 32-bit(at training) to 8-bit(at inference).On the other hand, traditional Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures has two main parts – the edge and the cloud. The edge is the part of the system that is closest to the source of data. It includes sensors, sensing infrastructures, machines, and the object being sensed. The edge actively works to sense, store, and send that data to the cloud.So how does quantization help with edge computing? Does it have the potential of changing how we run models on the cloud?TALK AGENDAIntroduction 5 minsA Beginner's Guide to Quantization 5 minsUnderstanding Quantization in TPUs 10 minsDemo Implementation of Quantization in Edge computing 10 mins",Knowledge on Tensor Processing Unit .Knowledge of IoT and Edge ComputingKnowledge of Deep Learning,You can view my blogs1.

Me and my six year old daughter designed and built this project to have fun with friends and learn a bit about computers along the way.Adafruit’s Circuit Playground Express is a fantastic $25 computer packed with sensors, buttons, LEDs and a little speaker. Add this DIY Snow Globe Kit and some Conductive Thread and we have the makings of an ingenious Snow globe intruder alert system. All written in python using a simple text editor without the need for any special software, drivers or soldering.The globe has a rainbow mode that randomly fades different colors in and out and an alarm mode to detect intruders. Modes can be switched by giving the globe a tap which it detects with it’s motion sensors. Once in alarm mode the globe will flash green until an intruder steps on the conductive thread which will sound the alarm and flash the globe red.The Circuit Playground was used to teach my six year old daughter the differences between computer inputs and outputs and how to issue commands to computers using the Python REPL. She learned about the different frequencies of sound waves by calling the beep function with different frequencies. This opened up the topic of the hearing range of humans compared to other animals like dogs.

But with the use of peer to peer, BitTorrent protocol, it is relatively easy for us to share our data. But there is a problem in here. It is not fully decentralized. There are still centralized servers that host these files. Moreover we at our college find it quite difficult to share our study material over LAN as nobody hosts their study materials (duh!!!). So we decided to create a decentralized file sharing application that enables us to share our file to all our friends even if we didn’t hosted it on a server.In this talk we will be explaining the basics of decentralization. We will expand on what and how this could be used to make a file sharing application. We will also shed some light on how to make a fairly secure file sharing application based on the topics we will be covering at the beginning of our talk. Once we are through with the theory and our code, we would be presenting our proof of concept i.e. a small demo of the application.Outcome of the Talk-After this talk you would expect to learn the basics of decentralized network, how to make a secure decentralized application and successfully learn how to make a decentralized file sharing system.Agenda-Brief Introduction of Decentralization.

Neural Networks have a lot of parameters (millions of them) which are trained iteratively in a data-driven fashion. With these many parameters come huge representational power (ability to model hyper dimensional complex functions). In cases where we train a custom classifier (say a CNN), we might not be having that much data so the network can easily overfit when trained from scratch. So here comes transfer learning, use the previously accumulated knowledge (in form of weights in neural nets) to learn our problem. In case of fine-tuning also we will be training final layers of the network only. (If you are not aware don't worry this will be covered). Huge networks take significant time train completely. To reduce this time comes methods of effective caching  or informally called Training with BottlenecksThis method though is easy to implement, can give very good results.ResNet50 which took 45 sec for an epoch to train using normal transfer learning procedure, now takes 8 sec per epoch.

Hence, they are hindered by the reality that in most practical situations unlabelled data is easier to come across and obtaining appropriately annotated and labelled data may be prohibitively expensive. Herein lies the appeal of semi-supervised learning algorithms that allow us to draw inferences with only a few labelled data samples existing among a vast amount of unlabelled data. In this talk. through the application of a variation of the tried and tested SVM, called the S3VM(Semi Supervised SVM) on standard dense and sparse data sets, we will explore the merits and demerits of semi-supervised learning. We will also take a cursory look at a few approaches used to solve the modified optimisation problem that arises when we adapt the SVM for use in a semi-supervised setting.The outline of the talk will broadly be the followingWhy Semi-Supervised LearningAdvantages of using Semi-Supervised algorithms rather than Supervised algorithms on limited dataApproaches to Semi-Supervised Learning Transduction vs Induction+DeductionModifying the SVM for Semi-Supervised LearningApproaches for solving the modified SVM Label-switching vs deterministic annealingSemi-Supervised Learning is not a silver bullet Discussion of disadvantages",Familiarity with Python ProgrammingMinimal proficiency in Optimisation Methods Intermediate proficiency in Support Vector Machines,SlidesTalk Specific Slides On Their WayReferencesQN-S3VM Python Package http//www.fabiangieseke.de/index.php/code/qns3vmSemisupervised Learn Python Package https//github.com/tmadl/semisup-learnS3VM Seminal Work https//papers.nips.cc/paper/1582-semi-supervised-support-vector-machines.pdf,"I'm Indraneil Paul, a final year Computer Science student at IIIT Hyderabad.

Sarcasm Detection in Natural Language Processing,uday1201,"27 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/sarcasm-detection-in-natural-language-processing~eXAga/,Beginner,Talks,Data science,"27 Jun 2018, 15:19",17,"Sarcasm is an intensive, indirect and complex construct that is often intended to express contempt or ridicule. But in speech, it is multi-modal, involving tone, body language, and gestures along with linguistic artifacts used in speech. Sarcasm in the text, on the other hand, is more restrictive when it comes to such non-linguistic modalities. This makes recognizing textual sarcasm more challenging for both humans and machines.Sarcasm detection plays an indispensable role in applications like online review summarizers, dialog systems, recommendation systems and sentiment analyzer. This makes automatic detection of it an important problem. However, it has been quite difficult to solve such a problem with traditional NLP tools and techniques.So we will talk about the ongoing research and techniques developed to counter these problems. I have been trying to solve this problem for a while now so let's discuss it and hope that we solve it in the near future.

The main The aim is not to merely show the audience how to implement the detector that can work on videos, but give them a deep insight about the problems that rear their heads only when one is implementing a deep architecture. Some of these issues include, Rapid Prototyping with PyTorch Which PyTorch classes and abstractions to use to quickly code up neural network. How to implement a layer if it doesn't already ship with PyTorch. Our detector has 3 such layers! How to deal with complex architectures efficiently What if your network has more than a 100 layers? Our detector certainly has 106! Do we write 106 lines of code for each layer? What if we want to run our detector over a folder containing 100000 images that we can't fit into our RAM at once. Best PyTorch practices to get around problems like these will be discussed. Speeding up Python code with Vectorisation Python can be a slow language, but PyTorch does provide a lot of functions that are merely wrappers for super fast C code under the hood. Vectorisation and broadcasting will be covered in great detail. Using vectorised code instead of loops to do iterative tasks can give speed ups as much as 100x. Our detector can not work in real time without these optimisations.Managing GPU resources How to write device-agnostic code, parallelize GPU/CPU ops, practices to reduce redundant GPU memory usage, and how to time GPU code.[HTML_REMOVED]We will review the entire code base, and spend much time on justifying design decisions. A lot of non-critical code will be provided as it is to the audience, while they are expected to code along when it comes to the critical parts. These parts would be discussed in greater detail.  Important PyTorch features might also be demonstrated using toy examples outside the detector code base, which the audience is also expected to code along.  A docker image as well as Jupyter notebook will be provided to the audience. Google Colab may also be considered with notebooks provided. Most of the tutorials online demonstrate how to write code that is more proof-of-concept rather than being performant. When it comes to learning to code complex architectures, especially when we are transitioning from beginner to intermediate stage, most of us have to rely on the laborious process of reading open source code. The idea of this workshop is to help audience move along this journey.

Tensorflow 101,Jaidev Deshpande (~jaidev),"25 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/tensorflow-101~dB7Ye/,Intermediate,Workshops,Data science,"31 Jul 2018, 11:53",6,"This tutorial is meant to familiarize participants with Tensorflow, generally as a tensor library and particularly as a tool for doing day-to-day machine learning tasks. The ultimate goal of the tutorial is to be able to make participants comfortable enough with it so that they can use tensorflow as a scalable substitute for other ML libraries like sklearn.Why Learn Tensorflow?For the same reason that you should learn NumPy. Tensorflow is to Keras (and many other deep learning libraries) what NumPy is to sklearn (and many other machine learning libraries). It is the underlying data model of many deep learning applications. There are always nooks and crannies in any deep learning application that high level wrapper libraries cannot reach. The tutorial is aimed at making these accessible and debuggable with tensorflow.What will I learn?The focus of the tutorial would be on loss functions - ensuring their fundamental correctness with respect to the machine learning problem at hand, ensuring their differentiability and convergence are critical to solving a deep learning problem. There are many ready-made loss functions in tensorflow, and using these as building blocks, we will see how to make arbitrarily complex loss functions.Tentative PlanTensorflow Basics (30 - 45 minutes)Tensors and operationsGraphs and sessionsMachine learning with Tensorflow (60 - 90 minutes)Estimators, datasets and modelsAutomatic differentiationLoss functions &amp; differentiability of operationsLayers and networksIntroduction to Tensorboard (30 minutes)Visualizing Tensorflow graphsPlotting learning curvesFAQsQ. Will I need a GPU?A. No. The beauty of tensorflow is that it can seamlessly deploy code to GPUs, without you needing a GPU to develop that code.Q. What is the format of the tutorial?A. Being a tutorial, this session is meant to be highly interactive in nature. It will be a sequence of units where concepts are first explained and then the audience will have to solve exercises in a Jupyter notebook.Q. I don't know anything about neural networks or deep learning. Should I attend this tutorial?A. Absolutely.

Open Library - One Web Page for every book ever Published,Salman Shah (~salman96),"25 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/open-library-one-web-page-for-every-book-ever-published~aA7ld/,Beginner,Workshops,Web development,"03 Jul 2018, 00:00",59,"This Workshop is designed to guide developers who are interested in learning more about the basics of open source software and contributing to their first open source project. We'll look at Open Library, a mature open source project, and see how 20 open source contributors are able to make contributions which impact over a million international users. You’ll learn what tools, best practices, and processes help make an open source project successful and what beginning steps you can take to enter the open source world.What is Open Library?Open Library is a non-profit online library created by Aaron Swartz and Brewster Kahle in 2006 with the mission of “One Web Page for every book ever published”. Open Library is written in  Python using the web.py micro-framework, and is open source on Github. Open Library uses Infobase, its own database framework based on PostgreSQL and Infogami which is its own Wiki Engine using Python. Why Open Library?Open Library has an active, supportive community, newcomer-friendly issues, and mature documentation , which makes it a good candidate for engineers who are looking to contribute to their first open source project . Some of the advantages of having Open Library as your entry to the world of Open Source Software are as followsOpen Library is very easy to install and has simple and straight-forward instructions.Issues for Beginners are labelled as first-timer-issues on the repository to help beginners get over their fear of contributing to Open Source and making it a simple process for them.Open Library has a community call every week in order to catch up the progress that each contributor is making.There is a Slack channel where anyone can be invited to and GitHub issues for communication.There is an updated Wiki which keeps getting updated as contributors contribute to the project.All coding procedures followed by Open Library are documented in a CONTRIBUTING / Getting Started guide.Some of the opportunities for new developers looking to get started to contributing to Open Library are as followsOpen Library does poorly as compared to global standards (like a modern js build system) and this is a huge opportunity for people who want to contribute to Open Library.it relies on a lot of custom code like Infogami and Infobase which are not well maintained anymore and are mostly in Python 2. So there is huge opportunity here in building a complete system while migrating to Python 3 while making sure you do retain the ease of the old code. Session PlanCreating a Github account and finding us on Github. Comment on the Slack Invite Issue to be added to the Open Library Slack Org. Understand how communication works on Open Library and getting familiar with using Github Issues and Slack for communication. Introducing yourself to the Open Library Community on Slack and initiating to become an 'Open Library Librarian'. This stage also involves talking with the Open Library community and finding Issues that match your interest.A simple and brief introduction to Git(clone, add, commit, push, pull) and Github (Fork, PRs, Issues).Setting up the project on your local dev environment. Reading Documentation as this is an important part of learning to contribute to Open Source Software.Using the Github Bug Tracker to find First Timer Issues to resolve and work on them.  Making your first commit as a Open Library Librarian and  submitting a Pull Request.Getting your Pull Request Merged after following community guidelines.

In some jurisdictions (Eg Europe), platform providers are required by law to remove such content within 24 hours of posting or risk hefty fines (upto €50M in Germany). In order to meet the governance mandate, we need to have systems in place that can automatically detect abusive content at scale. This talk is based on my practical experience of building an automated solution to solve this problem.This talk begins with discussing some of the approaches currently being employed for offensive content detection at scale word filtering, rule-based systems and actual human annotation.The former two are restricted by the followingOffensive content is context specific. A given word (f*ck) can be used in both positive (that’s f*cking awesome) and negative (that’s f*cking terrible) contexts.Robustness to spelling variations (The word ‘shit’ can be spelt as ‘sh*t’, ‘sh!t’, etc)Failure to detect content that is offensive in idea but uses non-offensive words. (Eg your mom is a fat cow, X people are inferior, etc)Manual human annotation is notoriously hard and expensive to scale. The talk presents a Deep neural network based approach to overcome the previously mentioned limitations. It introduces and discusses the building blocks of model architecture (deep convolutional networks, word embeddings, etc).The second half of the talk focuses on implementing the model to solve the problem at scale as a RESTful micro-service using python, Django, Tensorflow and Docker. This architecture can also be used to implement other text classification systems (eg sentiment detection, user intent detection systems, topic-of-discussion classifiers, etc.), making the talk relevant for a wider user base.Attendees willGain insights into building deep learning based text-classification systems that can scaleLearn the nitty gritties of the offensive content detection and text classificationLearn about the basic concepts of Deep Learning and NLP (convolutional neural nets, multi-layer perceptron, word embeddings, etc.)Understand the scientific and software challenges involved in text classification and learn to overcome themBe able to apply the learnings from here to other text classification problems as well","Elementary knowledge of PythonBasic understanding of machine learning (nice to have, not mandatory)An open mind ;)",A similar version of this talk was recently delivered at Pycon APAC2018 (Singapore).

This may limit the server performance and lead to enhancements or fixing before you go for production. Now any Load testing tools available comes with below problems Preparing the environment / infrastructure (installing various software dependencies) on multiple host systems to perform load test at times very tedious task. It requires maintenance and manual interventions to scale up and scale down load test.You have to write your own test codes, need some development effort. Most of the stress tools comes with their own format of reporting, very difficult to customize if it’s really needed. Also it’s difficult to view, analyze and compare test results real time across systems.Here in today’s talk we are going to demonstrate how JAAS (JMeter As A Service) can be a one stop solution for all these problems.

Caching can speed up an application if a computationally complex question is asked frequently. Instead of the computing the answer over and over, we can use the previously cached answer.Caching is an important component while scaling applications which are to be used by many users. It solves various problems related to cost and latency. Usually it takes more time to retrieve data from DB rather than cache. Using a cache to avoid recomputing data or accessing a slow database provides us with a great performance boost.I will describe in depth the different methods of Caching, their pros and cons. This talk will help developers focus on their code before scaling their applications. It will provide immense performance improvements with this simple concept.Outcomes The novice audience will be able to understand basic Caching Mechanisms.

The method of analyzing the time series by seasonal breakdown will be explored and the work flow of solving the problem will be explained.In the first half of the talk, an introduction about time series and its characteristic will be explained for audiences who is new to analysis on time series. The data we use will be from a business to business travel company. It has seasonality thought out the year, a weekly cycle and also a growing trend in business. As the company have clients around the world, data from different countries will shows different behaviors as well. Therefore, before we show the analysis, the complexity of the data will be explored. In the second half, we will introduce a open source Python library called Seasonal.

In this talk, we use the hotel room search requests from travel agents, including online public website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them. By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be extract by studying network properties.In the first half of the talk, we will explain how the network is built using NetworkX, an open-source python library that is designed for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. When 2 agents are making the same search at the same time , a link ( or an “edge” in network analysts terms) is made pointing form the initial searcher to the subsequent searcher. Using a list of these searches, a directed graph is built. We will also demonstrate how to pick the biggest connected component out form the graph. In the second half, with the graphs created, we show how different functions of NetworkX can be used to study the graphs. By compare the graph properties of our graph to the other popular network graphs, we can get the insight of how the network was created. Also by studying the graphs, we can understand the behavior of the agents and can even figure out which agents are acting as main hubs in the network.This talk is for people who are interested in network analysis and would like to see how it can be used in a business case. Audiences with any level of python experience can learn some basic concept of network analysis work and how it can be applied to provide business insights.","None, it's a beginner friendly talk.",The library shown in the talk is an open source library which is available on Github https//github.com/networkx/networkxSlides (not finalized) https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_Wmuv_hqs8OZTI8XLJ5ajvjEpllK7Xeifa52yTpw-k/edit?usp=sharing,"After spending 5 years doing research in theoretical physics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Cheuk has transferred her analytical and logical skills in natural science and built a career in data science.

Fuzzy Matching - Smart Way of Finding Similar Names Using FuzzyWuzzy,Cheuk Ting Ho (~Cheukting),"15 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/fuzzy-matching-smart-way-of-finding-similar-names-using-fuzzywuzzy~epKVd/,Beginner,Talks,Data science,"15 Jun 2018, 11:39",3,"Ever encounter a tricky situation of knowing there’s names that are the same, but matching strings straight away leads you no where? All you need is FuzzyWuzzy, a simple but powerful open-source Python library and some wit. This talk will demonstrate how to efficiently fuzzy match company names.Matching strings should be one of the first natural language processing problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data. Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company” and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same?In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions in FuzzyWuzzy like “partial_ratio” and “token_sort_ratio” will also be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the second half, we will start tackling the example problem matching company names, we will show that besides using FuzzyWuzzy, we have to also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners.","None, it's a beginner friendly talk.",The library shown in the talk is an open source library which is available on Github https//github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzySource code available on Github https//github.com/Cheukting/fuzzy-match-company-nameSlides (not finalized) http//slides.com/cheukting_ho/fuzzy-matching,"After spending 5 years doing research in theoretical physics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Cheuk has transferred her analytical and logical skills in natural science and built a career in data science.

The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.First we will briefly explain what is Docker and what is Terraform for audiences who has no experience in either or both of them. Some basic concepts of both tools will also be covered. After that, we will walk-through each steps of the work flow, which includes designing and building a Docker image, setting up a pipeline on Github and Docker Hub, writing the Terrafrom code and the start up script, launching an instance.

But can we even make them speak in particular ways, like as Trump or Shakespeare? In this hands on talk we will see how this is possible with the latest deep learning techniques combined with word embeddings and other advanced NLP technique.In this talk, first we would introduce two neural network and machine learning mechanisms which in popular and widely used in NLP (natural language processing) Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Network. Word Embeddings is a way to extract the context of a word by “learning” its presence in a paragraph; while Recurrent Neural Network, including LSTM (long short-term-memory), enable us to “train” sequential data. After that, we will showcase how to implement these mechanisms in a neutral network. With that, we can “build” a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun.In the first half of the talk, concepts of how Word Embeddings and LSTM works will be explained. Audiences will understand why this is essential in the field of NLP and why we are using it. In the second half, a code demo will be used to showcase how to implement these mechanisms. Through an example, audiences will learn how Keras is used together with Tensorflow and Python to build a sequential neutral network. We will showcase generating a paragraph using Shakespeare’s play and another one using Trump’s speech.This talk is for people who have some experience with data science and understand the concept of how a neural network works, but would like to go deeper into the details of how does it applied to NLP to solve more complex AI problems.

The Subtle Art of Effective Transfer Learning,niladri99,"14 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/the-subtle-art-of-effective-transfer-learning~dw5ra/,Intermediate,Talks,Data science,"28 Jun 2018, 12:31",31,"What is Transfer Learning?Transfer Learning is the method of reusing our existing knowledge developed for one task to solve a similar task. Say, you want to detect cars on night-time images and instead of learning from scratch we could reuse our existing knowledge from a model which has been trained on day-time images. Transfer learning allows us to deal with these scenarios by leveraging the already existing labeled data of some related task or domain.I believe Transfer Learning is a major achievement in our quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as Transfer Learning allows us to generalize our knowledge which is something we humans excel at. Andrew Ng, ex-chief scientist at Baidu, co-founder of Coursera and professor at Stanford, said during his widely popular NIPS 2016 tutorial,“Transfer Learning will be the next driver of ML success.”Training Deep Neural Networks from scratch is an expensive process. Not only does it require a lot of compute resources and time, deep Learning models require a huge amount of data and it is a major bottleneck when it comes to start-ups and niche areas of research like health care.What you will learn -How to build an image classifier in a few minutes using Transfer Learning When and how to fine-tune pretrained modelsFreezing layers of a pretrained model depending upon the scenarioUsing ConvNet as a    feature extractorUsing differential learning ratesConstraints of using pretrained modelsTransfer Learning  Beyond Computer VisionCross-Lingual Domain Adaptation  Using the knowledge we have learnt from one language and applying our knowledge to another language is another application of transfer learning with huge potential. Cross-lingual adaptation methods would allow us to leverage the vast amounts of labeled data we have in English and apply them to any language, particularly languages with very less labeled data such as Indian languages. Reinforcement Learning and Learning from Simulations  Training an agent (in Reinforcement Learning) to achieve general artificial intelligence directly in the real world is too costly and hinders learning initially through unnecessary complexity. It is better to train an agent in a simulated environment such as the OpenAI Gym before deploying it in the real world.

Their information model is so intensive, that practically all operations (health, inventory, metrics, configuration) on the device ends up in primarily as CRUD operations on the information model they expose.  Only a paltry few operations are exposed as APIs.When building an API for managing these devices, we realized that providing classic function-style APIs only degraded the user experience. What we realized was there was significant information available on the Servers, and providing an API for exposing traditional CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) for all information nuggets was just exploding the API sets.  It was not necessarily covering all the scenarios that could be possible for management and did not seem to scale.Our approach was to take this information model within the devices and expose them as a huge navigable data structure representing the entire spectrum of the device and provide a language native experience. We created a new type manager leveraging the python class special operators (getattr(), setattr(), le() etc.) to create a whole new type manager that provides additional controls and safeguards.  Some of the safeguards includeNot allowing edits to read-only componentsAllowing only applicable changes only (ranges, enumerations)Providing native python experience for special types (IP Address Types etc.)Providing mechanisms to validate cross-attribute validationsProviding custom indices for arrays (like Virtual Disks, Users)Providing mechanism for tracking changes to configurationApply changes to the device optimallyProvide mechanisms for identifying configuration driftsOutline Outline of the presentationIntroductionDevice Configuration - Aspects &amp; PeculiaritiesPitfalls of API approach for Device Configuration Type Manager - introductionSuper Types - Enumerations, Fields, Classes and ArraysBringing in Native Type ExperienceData as API - Enriched user experienceDemoQ&amp;AKey takeways to audienceAudience will get an exposureHow to create your own type manager by overloading python type constructsExposure to alternative approach to creating APIs for data-heavy systems &amp; explore benefitsLearn how type manager simplifies your life as well as the life of your consumers.Secrets of the python inbuilt __ operators - and how you can leverage them to provide native type experience even for your own custom classesHow you can create a better user experience for customers in a simple wayHow you can incorporate Object Oriented SOLID principles","General familiarity with type concepts (fields, arrays, classes, enums) is neededExposure to in-built operators like (getattr etc. will help)Exposure to Systems Management would be useful.",http//github.com/vaideesg/omsdkhttp//github.com/dell/omsdk,"Vaideeswaran Ganesan, Senior Principal Technologist @ Dell EMC, has special focus in building systems management products for servers, networking and data center products.

Static blog generators have gained popularity over the last few years .  People who have been using Wordpress, Blogspot or Blogger are now shifting to Pelican , Jekyll  etc. One major annoyance was that Wordpress had a huge attack surface. Everytime someone found out a Wordpress exploit, your site was at risk.When comparing Blogger vs Pelican, the Slant community recommends Pelican for most people. In the question “What are the best solutions for a personal blog?” Pelican is ranked 10th while Blogger is ranked 14th.  Python is becoming more and more popular amongst programmers and so is Pelican . Pelican is a static blog generator and supports several formats like Markdown , ASCII etc . It  turns Markdown and some Jinja templates into the Full Stack Python site. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and even a non programmer can get started with Pelican in just a few lines of code and plain text . Over the past few years people have shifted from Wordpress to Pelican .This is because a static site has basically no attack surface, and can be hosted on free or inexpensive hosts like Github Pages .This talk is focused on introducing a simple static site generator to beginners and even avid bloggers who aren't coders .

In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object (image, text, sound). Feature engineering, the practice of extraction of features from objects is a combination of art and science; it requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is called ""feature learning,"" where a machine learns the features itself.One way to obtain features is to use the 'Bag-of-Features' model, the idea behind which is to simplify object representation as a collection of its subparts. Originally used for representing text data, the ""Bag-of-Words"" methodology can be extended to different types of objects resulting in models such as ""Bag-of-Visual-Words,"" ""Bag-of-Audio-Words."" The significance of these models in the age of self-learning deep networks still holds because of their ability to work with limited data.

Ever faced a ""No robots allowed! No web scraping allowed!"" message from a favorite site?This talk is for meant for you.Usually when you're done building a fancy web scraper and begin running the homebrew'd tool on your favorite site there's chances you'll face a block on your IP address preventing your computer from accessing more resources and therefore downloading the contents of the website. Your tool maybe fast, it might be scalable, it might be the best written scraper out there, but with just one IP address under your belt, it's easy for giants to block your ip address and prevent you from getting that precious data, especially if you've built a threadsafe and multi-node webscraper. Enter The Onion Router,The ToR project, allows you to use the the internet vis-a-vis a proxy and visit the same website under a different endpoint ip address, but that's just for one instance of ToR.What if you ran, say 200? at once? 200 ip addresses &gt; 1 ip address.With 200 endpoints and the latest update to the requests library, you can now use your multi-threaded and resource hungry webscraper and it can(not) be stopped! Whatever your rate of data collection, you can 200x it! The stack is simple, you open a SOCKS5 proxy per ToR endpoint, connect it to a request with it's own port number and you're good for that one request, same for multiple requests. You can build a task scheduler to orchestrate the url to scrape and the port number the tor endpoint is on and have the entire application running on a cloud service provider to ensure you face no bandwidth issues. The demo centered around the talk will attempt to rapidly and quickly scrape users from the famous social network Ask.fm which is known to restrict users from retreiving from their site if you attempt to download more than 4 users in under a second, but with the hack in place, you'll be retrieving close to maximum efficiency on a DigitalOcean droplet , but this can be applied to virtually any website and any cloud provider.

Helping oncologists to take complex decisions in treating cancer.,siddharth srivastava (~siddharth40),"01 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/helping-oncologists-to-take-complex-decisions-in-treating-cancer~axylb/,Beginner,Talks,Others,"01 Jun 2018, 19:42",0,"Mention of “Cancer” evokes words like tumor, chemotherapy, hair loss, vomiting and pain. Interestingly our knowledge and thereby cancer treatment has changed radically in the past few years and is changing rapidly every passing day. In 2003, human genome was sequenced and for the first time we could read entire human DNA from end to end. Interestingly DNA and cancer are deeply connected. Scientists deciphered that always a change in DNA (mutation) led to cancer (oncogenic mutation). Cigarette smoking, alcohol, pollution etc only led to such DNA change (oncogenic mutations). This led to numerous diagnostic companies starting to extract and sequence tumor DNA, to detect the root cause of each patient tumor. While drug companies formulated new drugs that targeted specific DNA change (mutation). These were called targeted therapies which were very different from chemotherapy in being very precise, less toxic, less side effects and they could be taken orally just like any regular pill. Thus, an oncologist (cancer doctor) could treat a cancer tumor effectively if s/he knew the precise location of mutation in the entire patient tumor DNA and the drug that targeted it. Suddenly oncologists in India and elsewhere, found themselves struggling to comprehend tumor DNA and the technology around it. Already burdened with tomes of ever changing patient treatment guidelines, now they were needed to integrate tumor DNA information to make accurate treatment decisions. For eg. NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, USA) which publishes treatment guidelines for all cancer for oncologists across the world, published lung cancer guidelines that is 271 pages long. To this, add the complex data of patient’s tumor DNA, various mutation databases, clinical trials and research papers. Modern day oncologist are often overwhelmed. They need tools to simplify and hasten their decision making.I am a molecular biologist who understands the tumor DNA and the technologies around it. As Chief Scientist (molecular oncology) of Neuberg diagnostic lab, I also write patient DNA reports that guide oncologists to take treatment decisions.  While meeting various oncologists and marketing them different DNA tests for different type of cancers, I got acutely aware of the problems oncologists faced. To simplify their decision making, I created algorithms that combined patient’s clinical history, histo-pathology data, molecular test decisions, mutational databases and NCCN guidelines. Subsequently I coded these integrated and complex decision algorithms as Python programs that can be executed from a browser. They are available for free and oncologists are/can use it.Programs in Python for lung cancer and colorectal cancers https//sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming?authuser=0 My article on need of Python programing for cancer treatment https//sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming/is-it-time-for-precision-medicine-app?authuser=0",Interest in using programing to resolve healthcare problems in India.,Programs in Python for lung cancer and colorectal cancers https//sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming?authuser=0,"I am a PhD in Biochemistry with significant research experience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in the areas of molecular oncology, cardiovascular biology and biology of infectious diseases.

This talk is based on my experiences in the project with respect to the test suite and the different things that I learned in that. On the bases of those learnings, I started my own open source project on Github and enhanced on those ideas on how all the things necessary for testing are done. This is based on Flask as the web framework and all the ideas are implemented in it. The topics it covers are those things that you can do to achieve a robust set of tests in your code.DisclaimerSome of the tricks and suggestions mentioned in this talk will pertain to web applications developed using Flask microframework. It might or might not work with other frameworks out there.The code snippets shown on the slides and the live demo (if possible) will be of Flask.Outline of the talkArchitecture of the application explains the simple architecture of the application which will make it easy to build all the concepts of testing on top of it. This will consist of the basic description of the layers in a typical web application like the database layer, services, and controllers.Tests at various layers will highlight the different tests at different layers, this also consists of which test are more important than which other tests and why. This will consist of different types of tests like unit tests, repo tests, HTTP tests etc.TDD top to bottom through the layers you can go from top to down when doing TDD by first starting to write your first test at an API level looking at yourself as a consumer of the API that you are writing the test for. This can happen with starting writing the tests for HTTP REST endpoint that is exposed and then going deep into the layers.Unit testing and the evil of mocking will talk about how unit tests are written in our industry and how tests doubles are overused which leads to various problems with respect to the wholeness of the part tested by the test.Speeding up test execution sometimes the reason people avoid running tests is that they take a very long time to run. One of the main things in test-driven development is that we should be able to run tests as frequently as possible, for that the tests need to be fast.Predictable test tests can become indeterminate, i.e. we can't predict whether a test will either pass or fail. Tests should always pass when they are supposed to pass and should fail always when they are supposed to. We can perform dependency injection for the objects which have random behaviour.Test ice-cream cone vs test pyramid vs test cylinder, where to focus in our industry there is too much of focus on writing a lot of unit tests and a lesser number of tests as you go up the layers of the architecture. The argument usually is that tests get slower as you go up. What if this is not that much of an issue anymore? It is good if all scenarios are tested end to end.Pushing code coverage towards 100% forcing your CI tests to increase the code coverage slowly and gradually and never let the code coverage drop. We can have things like forcing the CI to fail in case if the code coverage drops.","Although most of the things are implemented in Flask, it is not necessary to know it, although it is very much recommended to know some web framework or having some knowledge of web app programming.",The repository where I have implemented concepts related to this talk https//github.com/tanayseven/http_quizContents for the presentation for the talk https//github.com/tanayseven/pycon_2018_python_web_app_test,A passionate developer with Python as his primary language.

Whereas, object tracking is like you are spying on someone and following it. Done in motion images like in animated gifs or videos, we want to track how an object is moving, where is it going, or its speed.Although it has been studied for dozens of years, object detection and tracking remains an open research problem. The difficulty level of this problem highly depends on how you define the object to be detected and tracked. If only a few visual features, such as a specific color, are used as representation of an object, it is fairly easy to identify all pixels with same color as the object. On the other extremity, the face of a specific person, which full of perceptual details and interfering information such as different poses and illumination, is very hard to be accurately detected, recognized and tracked.Thus, I believe it is important to address such challenges via a comparative study of object tracking and object detection in python.

But more importantly, the underlying technology is gaining the attention among the developers. Many developer communities inspired by bitcoin have created their own platform to use the underlying technology widely known as ""blockchain"" to achieve decentralization. Ethereum is one such platform that has created a blockchain platform which allows developers to develop their own decentralized applications (dApps) in the ethereum network by coding the logic in the execulatable contracts called ""smart contracts"". Although ethereum has gained a huge fame due to its smart contract implementation to create decentralized applications, it imposes developer to write the logic in an ethereum's domain-specific language called Solidity. In addition to coding in a new language, it mandates the developer to set up a new develop environment.NEO blockchain platform provides a convenient way to develop smart contracts in general purpose programming language. NEO achieves this by providing compilers to compile code written in most of the languages to bytecode that can be executed in NEO virtual machine. Currently, NEO allows compilation of python smart contracts through neo-python project.  This is the first blockchain project to provide such a freedom to the developer.NEO project provides plenty of benefits over other blockchain platforms out there. It plans to achieve smart economy by creating a strong digital identity. It achieves faster transaction rate which is the key to scale any platform.

PyTorch is increasing becoming popular due to it's powerful features and shallow learning curve, making it accessible and easy to use to a larger community. This talk discusses about the 'Autograd' package, which is central to all neural networks in PyTorch. It also entails details about the different features and functionalities of PyTorch as well as equip the audience on how to create simple and complex Neural Networks in PyTorch. PyTorch helps to create dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static computation graphs. It offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network.Outline of the TalkThe talk will be broadly divided into 3 broad parts.Part 1 will be an Introduction to PyTorch. This part will focus on the use and need for PyTorch as a deep learning framework. This will be followed by instructions on how to setup PyTorch and a look at the basic building blocks behind the framework.Part 2 will dive more into the features of PyTorch, mainly it's AutoGrad package which lies at the heart of all Neural Networks created in PyTorch and PyTorch's ability to create dynamic computational graphs as opposed to the static computational graphs offered by some of it's counterparts (such as TensorFlow and Caffe).Part 3 will be a more 'hands on' part where the talk will focus on how to create and build simple as well as complex neural networks (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) with the framework.",A basic understanding of how Neural Networks work would be beneficial.Some knowledge about Numpy.,https//pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.htmlSlides (https//slides.com/rahulbaboota/deck),"I am Rahul Baboota, a 3rd Year Undergraduate in India studying Computer Science and Engineering.

But since the dawn of time, developers have been debugging code there's no escaping that. Software testing, as the elders would tell you, is one of the greatest weapons in your arsenal against those bugs. It's easy to write tests. It helps you write more robust software. And it really helps you sleep at night and your on-call ops team would love you! But testing is also deeply mystified, unfortunately. Beginners, and sometimes even seasoned developers, generally have a difficult time just to get started so they eventually miss out on this easy way to attain peace of mind.This talks aims at removing all the mystery around software testing in Python, and give the attendees a head-start into the easiest way of writing tests for their code. As part of being a Python developer for the past 8 years and leading a team of developers building enterprise-grade software for the past 4 years, I've learnt immensely about the important role of software testing in building scalable, durable software; and also a better, pragmatic way of thinking about testing in Python.

The Serverless Framework - Build a Chatbot,Vaibhav Singh (~vaibhavsingh97),"14 May, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/the-serverless-framework-build-a-chatbot~eZXgb/,Beginner,Talks,Others,"04 Jun 2018, 02:47",23,"AbstractThink of wireless internet, but has the wire somewhere. Serverless architecture still has the server behind P.  What serverless actually means that developer should focus on the code rather than thinking about the servers. As a technique, it removes most of the manel parts of an application, so you can actually spend your day coding. This means that you, developers, can quickly create apps that handle production-ready traffic. You do not have to actively manage scaling for your applications. You do not have to provision the server, or to pay for resources that are unused. The serverless movement started with the release of AWS Lambda, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute service. But serverless is much more than just FaaSChatbots have been around for quite a long time. But why this sudden surge and interest in chatbots now? Well, there are various reasons. Unlike the earlier days, many AI and NLP capabilities are now available as consumable services. Also, serverless technologies make chatbots easier to build and scale. The question is, how is the backend served? Would you set up a dedicated server (or a cluster of servers)? That’s costly, painful, and time-consuming! or You will deploy it to Heroku, which will eventually sleep (only happens in the free tier) if no one uses your chatbot.  Imagine suddenly, traffic increased your chatbot is used by thousands of people at a time.  When Heroku free tier is over, the application crashed or you exceeded memory limit. What would you do now? That’s where serverless technology can help.Benefits of serverlessNo Administration - We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.Scalability - One doesn't have to care about auto-scaling,  No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.Cost - Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.Faster Development - Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It's easier than ever to make your idea live.Easy Integration With Other ServicesGoing serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.Session key TakeawaysThe main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you. This talk will help people to move a step ahead of the traditional way of writing code as some of you had already developed chatbot, I will share how can you can write the simple chatbot in python and can take leverage of serverless to deploy and publish. I will coverServerless Framework principalsAWS Lambda, Amazon Lex and API GatewayHow to write a chatbot in python and create a Lambda functionHow to troubleshoot in a serverless world",Basic knowledge of python and development in general.,"I will soon share presentation, resources, and code soon on GitHub.","Vaibhav Singh is an undergrad final year student of BML Munjal University, Gurugram.

Swing and a Miss: Deploying machine learning models for IoT enabled devices using Python,sanjiv soni (~sanjiv),"14 May, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/swing-and-a-miss-deploying-machine-learning-models-for-iot-enabled-devices-using-python~bYXYa/,Intermediate,Talks,Data science,"14 May 2018, 13:05",34,"AbstractThe primary purpose of this talk to describe how we are using python and Sklearn to model and analyse time series sensor data. In particular, I will walk through how we use Python to process data from an IoT enabled sensor attached to a cricket bat, build machine learning models on the data, and use open source tools to deploy our models in the sensor device as a smart IoT application.DescriptionWith the steep increase in the number of smart-things connected to the internet, the amount of data that is being generated by such devices is increasing exponentially. However, much of that data is not useful and therefore filtering unuseful data is an important task. How do we filter the important part and remove the noise from sensor data streams to generate actionable insights?To demonstrate the problem we are placing a sensor device on a cricket bat. The IoT device is a miniaturised, wireless MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU). The IMU incorporates three-axis sensing of bat acceleration and angular velocity with a low-power Bluetooth to transmit this data to a mobile.First, we gather event-based data rather than storing the entire stream. This again poses the question how do we define an event? What makes an event unique from the surrounding ‘non-event’ context? These are some of the questions that need to be answered in order to define an event. Watching a cricket batter stand and prepare to swing, the human brain continuously filters its visual perception and is able to detect and differentiate a swing from the pre- and post-swing activity. We need to be able to automate that same process. Some data instances can be tagged while other can’t be. This helps in training and evaluating machine learning models later.Secondly, After we have extracted time series data based on the instances, we can start analysing these event-based sets of data to understand the language of sensor data. For this, we are using Jupyter Lab to interactively work with data. How does an accelerometer data depict the real world physical motion? This step helps us find the relation between the real world actions and the sensor data set. Well, the extraction process will be prone to noises. The data comes in CSV files, python seems the right choice for us to read and analyse the data. Pandas and offer data frames that come handy to rapidly form and validate hypothesis interactively in Jupyter notebooks. Any analysis is incomplete without visualisation, that's where Matplotlib helps us understand the data better. We quickly test the machine learning models by using Sklearn, which has most of the standard algorithms already implemented. This keynote will describe some of the analysis (along with python code) to show how we have taken several steps right from forming the hypothesis to implementing a solution in the device level layer. All of this demonstrates how Python and its rich set of libraries are helpful in forming solutions to some of the product related features.Thirdly, we need to automate the task of classifying a particular instance from the stream. For this to happen, we can either feed a machine learning model or create a rule-based algorithm which can classify the events into buckets. Now every step has its own set of challenges, firstly the application we are working on involves using motion sensors attached to the back of a cricket bat. There are network constraints in the field. If a sportsperson wants to know real-time analytics from the device, the segregation needs to happen offline. We have to deploy the models on the miniature sensor devices because sometimes the players don’t even carry their mobile phones to the playing area. Therefore our objective is to enable the devices to remain independent in running machine learning algorithms by themselves.",Participants should have an understanding of python basics.,Sensor Fusion Introductionhttps//youtu.be/C7JQ7Rpwn2kSklearn Quick Tutorialhttp//scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html,"Sanjiv Soni is a data scientist at Str8bat, Bangalore.

Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics. - To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like numpy and matplotlib. - To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.The library is still in a nascent stage but will take shape in a couple of months. Given that the commit frequency is huge. The audience is requested to be patient.LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) -When you are writing a machine algorithm from scratch you want to make sure that your results are coherent and your model is learning the features it is meant to learn. LIME explains why your model behaved the way it did.[HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]I will quote excerpts from their blog below - Imagine we want to explain a classifier that predicts how likely it is for the image to contain a tree frog. We take the image on the left and divide it into interpretable components (contiguous superpixels).   [HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]As illustrated below, we then generate a data set of perturbed instances by turning some of the interpretable components “off” (in this case, making them gray). For each perturbed instance, we get the probability that a tree frog is in the image according to the model. We then learn a simple (linear) model on this data set, which is locally weighted—that is, we care more about making mistakes in perturbed instances that are more similar to the original image. In the end, we present the superpixels with highest positive weights as an explanation, graying out everything else.  Even from a human's perspective these explanations do make sense.

Well, we did build one and turns out it's not as hard as it sounds.With thousands of people working towards democratising artificial intelligence (AI), we have seen an explosion in the availability of machine learning libraries that make it simpler to build and deploy models for a wide range of tasks. From finance to art, every field has been revolutionised by the  introduction of AI. At the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) we work on understanding the fundamental particles that constitute the universe by performing various experiments in particle physics. Of late, we have experienced a stratospheric rise in deep learning applications to various problems - RNNs, CNNs, and GANs - that have yielded promising results. Like, this stuff is so cool.

It will delieate the development isssues, and how it evolved from a set of scripts hastily patched together to a structured, cross-platform framework built on top of Tensorflow and Keras. The library is a WIP so we're shipping updates on a daily basis with the goal of improving usability with focus on documenting our existing code base. Initially envisaged to support the development of the namesake jet-tagger in the CMS Experiment at CERN, it has grown to encompass multiple purposes within the collaboration. It is aimed at outlining how to go from a set of scripts to building a library that is used by hundreds of scientists in the world's largest physics research collaboration.The presentation will describe the major features the environment sports simple out-of-memory training with a multi-threaded approach to maximally exploit the hardware acceleration, simple and streamlined I/O to help bookkeeping of the developments, and finally Docker image distribution, to simplify the deployment of the whole ecosystem on multiple datacenters.The talk will also cover future development aimed at improving user experience.","PreferredExperience working with virtual environments or AnacondaKnowledge of basic ideas within machine learning such as training, testing, and evaluation of modelsBasic knowledge of particle physics helpful but not required",https//github.com/DL4Jetshttps//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dDxxsMkfg8vwMi7QDkDaVwCQnxsaXVh9-6xrgrkLvnY/edit?usp=sharing,"Swapneel is a computer scientist working at Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research where physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe.

Currently healthcare is broken; there’s shortage of doctors; poor quality of care. There is a dire need to provide assistance to the whole medical industry to improve healthcare.PyTorch, which is a very popular modular deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation is an invaluable resource for such problems. It supports seamless conversion of Numpy arrays into GPU tensors and vice versa. The dynamic computational graph allows to change the network behavior on the fly unlike static graphs and due to Its highly modular nature helps in fast debugging.Unlike other production grade tools, Pytorch helps with lots of Research and Experimentation with novel architectures and is very useful to test ideas a bit more quickly and prototyping. With Medical Imaging being the field most impacted by AI, our goal in this workshop is to give a good head start covering the heuristics of Medical Imaging, the concepts involved in it and how to code your way out.This workshop would be divided into two halfs.First Half Pytorch IntroductionDuration 1 hourThe first half would be a gentle introduction to PyTorch framework.

Large scale web crawling using Python,Anand B Pillai (~pythonhacker),"29 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/large-scale-web-crawling-using-python~bkl6d/,Intermediate,Talks,Developer tools and Automation,"04 Oct 2018, 23:52",14,"Web crawling is hard. Large scale web crawling - which involves crawling millions of web pages in a month across 500 to 1000 websites, is even harder. Python comes with a number of libraries which allow you to do such crawling-at-scale but a lot of real-world issues have to be tackled to get the crawling infrastructure right Some of which are,Crawl rates - You need to strike the right balance here to make sure you don't crawl too aggressively but at the same time don't crawl too slow that the crawl finishes too late.Right Data - You need to make sure you crawl the right parts of the websites to get the right data you want.Dont get blocked! - Crawling from the same set of IP addresses will get you blocked across most modern websites. One needs some kind of rotating web proxy infrastructure to make sure that crawls can continue without getting kicked out.Capturing Errors - How to capture crawling errors so you can detect most issues and surface them up, while doing distributed crawling.Having nearly a decade of experience writing custom web-crawlers, the speakers have developed a set of custom tools to make crawling easy and painless. One of this is a tool to create a set of rotating web proxy caching nodes which use Squid and frontend by a HTTP load-balancer. The other one is a distributed crawler which uses Django as the middleware to distribute crawling across multiple crawler nodes while managing crawls at one place.In this talk, the author(s) discuss about one such tool they have created and have successfully used in multiple businesses and software companies over the last 3 years. The tool allows one to quickly and cheaply create an infrastructure of custom web proxy nodes which supports multiple VPS backends. Using this tool one can rune an industrial strength web crawling infrastructure with a set of rotating proxies of up to 50 nodes with a monthly cost of just under 300 $.The authors will talk about their experience and background creating and using the tool over the years, how it works with any web-crawler and the open source nature of the code which allows it to support different infrastructure backends and also the Squid configuration for the nodes which allows to hide the IP addresses behind the crawler.",Some knowledge of web crawling and or web scraping.Any knowledge of Scrapy and some experience using it is very handyKnowledge of HTTP proxy servers is a huge plus.,TBD,"Anand B Pillai is a technology professional with 20 years of software development, design and architecture.

Commands executed in command-line completion need to execute in less then 100ms or users will perceive a delay. In Shell scripting one might want to execute commands repeatedly in a for loop and fast execution times makes this more feasible.Python is a very powerful language but has a much slower startup time compared to other interpreted languages like Perl, Lua and Bash. It can take up to 10 times longer to startup then some of these other languages.MicroPython was written as a lean implementation of Python 3 with a small subset of the standard library mainly intended to run on microcontrollers. But it happily runs on Unix systems with excellent startup performance, making it an ideal candidate for implementing certain time sensitive commands.This talk willExplain when achieving fast execution times matters and when it doesn’t.Present two different approaches to measuring command execution time, one simple and the other more detailed and accurate.Compare execution times of a simple set of scripts that add two numbers in an number of different interpreted languages (micropython, python3, awk, perl, lua, bash).Present an example use case of MicroPython on Unix.

How Helpshift built machine learning platform using Python at large scale,Shyam Shinde (~shyam91),"28 Jun, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/how-helpshift-built-machine-learning-platform-using-python-at-large-scale~e0mLa/,Intermediate,Talks,Data science,"23 Sep 2018, 00:28",8,"AbstractThe purpose of this talk is to describe how helpshift has leveraged python ecosystem to build a machine learning platform without using any third party framework, and how you can build one too.In particular, You can learn how to build the following components of machine learning platform using python from this talk.How we use python celery framework to distribute model building tasks   to celery workersHow models heavier in size can be served to prediction node in real timeHow to monitor model building tasks on celery workerPython data science stack in Helpshift - Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etcPython libraries/framework used - Celery, S3/Azure Storage,  Bottle, etcDescriptionHelpshift provides customer service platform to around 2000+ companies across various business domains like gaming, e-commerce, IoT, banking, entertainment, travel, hospitality, productivity apps and many more. Helpshift provides a suite of ML features that include auto ticket classification, FAQ suggestions to user query and other features. As each company using our platform has a different business domain, we build separate ML models for each of our customer and for each of feature. To handle thousands of models and CRUD operations on them in production, we needed highly scalable and reliable machine learning platform for model building and serving models. Possible solution was to use Spark or Tensorflow for model building. But these frameworks did not provide facility to store thousands of models, and serve those for prediction in production. We decided to use celery framework for distributing model building tasks to celery workers and use core python data science libraries to build models.Model building using celery workerEach Celery worker in ML platform is registered to one or more model building queues. Each type of task is associated with one celery queue. In real time, the backend server submits model building task to pre-defined celery queue. One of available celery worker picks the pending task, builds the model and pushes it to blob storage like s3/azure with new model version. Model management in s3/azureWe have written python wrapper around s3/azure client library to provide all required CRUD operation on models in s3. CRUD operations are simple operations like get_model, put_model, update_model with some version. Serving models to prediction NodesModel size ranges from 5 - 25 mb. To do predictions within 30 ms, we have to either load all models in memory or store them on local disk of each prediction nodes. We decided to store all the models on local disk as loading them in memory was not a scalable approach. The challenge here is, whenever a particular model is updated, it has to be copied on each prediction node. A python service on the prediction node takes care of syncing updated model from s3 to local disk. Prediction servicePrediction service is gunicorn server which fetches model from local disk and does prediction on incoming requests. Monitoring model building task running on celery workerAs there are always some jobs in celery queue waiting for celery worker, we built active monitoring service which tracks the status of each submitted task. Monitoring service decodes metrics from celery worker to find failure of task and time spent by each task in waiting/running state. For any task that crosses the threshold time for wait or run state, an alert is sent.",Basic knowledge of Python ecosystemInterested in building scalable machine learning platform,Will share slides link soon..Key Takeaways from the talkWhy we decided to build our own machine learning platfrom from scratchHow to build machine learning platform using pythonLessons Learned while building machine learning servicesHow to extend this platform by distributed computation engine like Spark and deep learning platform like tensorflow,"Hello, I am shyam shinde,  actively developing machine learning platform at helpshift.I have diverse experience in developing backend systems, designing and developing system to handle big data.

It's a distributed computing platform letting users not have to care about infra and helping them concentrate mainly on business logic. By having your web app deployed on a kubernetes cluster you can make sure your app is highly available, and can fail-over when there's a problem. One of the main goals of the Kubernetes project is to democratize distributed computing. With Kubernetes being open source, Companies do not have to redo the mundane task of writing a distributed computing platform to achieve high availability, automated deployment, scaling and management of your applications. Kuberentes will take care of that for you. Kubernetes is also considered as a container orchestrator, as it manages containers to achieve the above said goals.In this talkWe will first write a basic python web app.Next, We will go through what a container isContainers are becoming the de-facto way of deploying applications as they remove the complexities of dependency management,etc. Running apps on Individual Containers provide the isolation almost to that of a Virtual Machine without having the overhead of having individual Kernels as they all share the host kernel. Isolation is provided by using kernel level features like cgroups and namespaces. We will containerize the application using docker and push it to a Container Registry. Once we have the image deployed to a registry, this image will be used to create instances i.e containers of the web app.We will next create a kubernetes cluster on Azure, all along going through what a Kubernetes cluster is, and its components. We will then deploy our python web app onto the cluster. Now As we have our python web app up and running, We can then do some experiments on how Kubernetes self-heals the application when a node goes down,etc. After that I will run down some points on where Kubernetes is being   used, its impact. To Finally answer the question, Is Containers and Kubernetes worth all the Hype?This talk will be demo focused, But before going to a demo we will have some slides explaining the overview of the components and how they work.By the end of the talk, Audience will have a brief overview of what containers and kubernetes are, and how to deploy a web app on Kubernetes.

MPEG DASH - Media Streaming,_arnAV,"10 Jul, 2018",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/mpeg-dash-media-streaming~dwv1b/,Intermediate,Talks,Networking and Security,"05 Oct 2018, 23:41",4,"Today DASH streams are being used industry wide in Live media (Twitch, Facebook Live, Youtube Live) and would be soon incorporated in static media delivery. We would try to go through most of the use cases we as a consumer or developer would need to utilize these or serve our very own livestream. MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is an ISO standard employing adaptive bitrate streaming technique which works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments. Each segment contains a short interval of playback time of content, served in several bitrates/codecs, where all of this information is enclosed in a XML media presentation description (MPD). Unlike conventional streaming protocols, this works with standard HTTP servers over TCP, and can fully utilize the benefits of HTTP/2 if both client and server supports it. Naturally, most CDN's and servers can serve the dynamic stream as segmented static media files, with one dynamic entry point which delivers the MPD serving the current time.Due to lack of open libraries handling DASH media, we would be building a DASH utility toolkit. It would be carrying out activities of segmenting (generation), re-merging (consumption), and clipping out a specific period of clip, where the on-media tasks are carried out by ffmpeg.

In this session, I will be talking about problems faced by data scientists in parallelizing their sequential workloads.I will be highlighting serverless technology as a solution to the problems. GCP Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda are popular serverless alternative for running parallel workloads due to their infrastructural simplicity. But, the problem comes again when we explore the API. To solve this problem, we built an abstraction which behaves exactly like Python Process Pool. This solves many problems like development overhead, limitations of server compute resources, infrastructural complexity and so on. The talk differentiates between running sequential workloads using Threads, Process, and Serverless Architecture. The idea is that attendees will go back with a knowledge of when and where to use serverless technologies and make an informed decision.This talk is not intended to be a tutorial to any technology.

For any task that can be solved with Supervised learning, we need a large dataset with Input-Labels pair. In real world applications, we often encounter scarcity of labelled data for training models in a supervised fashion. We usually have access to huge amounts of unlabelled data but the cost of labelling is too high or sometimes we don’t even have data points to label for the use case. Over the past few decades, Machine learning researchers have been trying to find the golden equation that will solve this problem. To find an algorithm that will just learn from unstructured / real world data without any labelling effort being required. In reality the world is still far away from that milestone. However, We have made significant progress towards that goal by incorporating techniques that require relatively less data and/or compute to train models. This talk will cover some of these techniques like Transfer Learning , Self Supervised Learning, Semi Supervised learning, etc.In real world applications, Transfer Learning has worked well in scenarios where the problems mentioned above were prevalent.

Sentaku - An abstraction layer library,Parthvi Vala (~valaparthvi),"01 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/sentaku-an-abstraction-layer-library~aAV1b/,Intermediate,Talks,Developer tools and automation,"30 Jul 2019, 21:14",NA,"What is Sentaku?Sentaku is an abstraction layer library. It allows to dynamically choose implementation of an object.How is Sentaku helpful?Sentaku is helpful while testing a system which has multiple layers implementing the same code, or while using different implementations for setup/teardown.A sample use case of Sentaku? Think of a modern day application that consists of different layers such as -A rich front-endAn Internal backendREST APIWhen doing test setup/teardown, we might want to get things done faster, say via REST API or the back-end, but while running the actual acceptance/system tests we might want to run it against the rich user interface. Sentaku makes it easy to select the implementation, i.e. choosing REST or UI or back-end to perform an operation.A little history about the library?Sentaku was developed as an internal library for ManageIQ's integration_test project. integration_tests contains test cases that have to deal with various layers of ManageIQ appliance, layers such as - UI, REST API, Database and Self-Service UI. integration_tests needed a tool that could make it easier to use the attributes/actions of domain objects via whatever layer they wanted. The plan was to to be able to abstract domain objects under use, so that it would become relatively easy to switch the implementation of an action/attribute to - UI/REST/DB/SSUI.In simpler words, one can define the elements of an application and all the actions/attributes related to it for the different layers and Sentaku will take care of choosing the implementation of the actions/attributes.Who would benefit from using Sentaku? Any project that has to deal with more than one layer, say UI and REST, can use Sentaku. Sentaku will help develop a more structured project where object and it's property/actions can be defined separately for all these layers, thus abstracting object from it's property/actions, making the object isolated from all these layers. This will also help write a more organized test suite for the project.Presentation outlineWhat is Sentaku?A bit of history about Sentaku, why was it written and why would one want to use it?How does Sentaku work?Demo on using Sentaku   - (An example of defining an object and it's actions and attributes with sentaku and 1-2 test cases to test it all)Slides Sentaku Google SlideSample code?

Have we ever think of solving this problem without updating all servers. It would be possible with SSH certificate-based authentication.SSH access with public key based authentication requires copying public key on each host from the user, this approach doesn’t scale well. The certificate authority (CA) issues a certificate with a public key, copying the CA public key to every host remove the need to copy the user’s key on every host. For the validation of any user, CA uses an X.509 attribute of ssh-keygen to sign a user’s public key and generate a certificate. While signing a certificate we can specify a version, serial number, identity, validity and access level (principals).There are alternative approaches to manage users using a central authentication system like LDAP or Kerberos. But centralize system has its own drawbacks. If the centralized system goes down you will lock out yourself from the system. For example at the time of downtime from the service provider or DNS outage.Here are some SSH CA features, which can increase securityCA offers certificate validity using which we can create a certificate for a limited validity, every time a user needs access to generate a certificate and access will be revoked in some time.Role-based access can be provided using the principals (attribute of ssh config).Each user will have a unique identity using which we can track user’s activities.SSH CA is a very efficient and secure way to provide SSH access to users.

It has naturally led to a veritable flood of applications using them including self-driving vehicles, face recognition, cancer diagnosis and even in next-gen shops. A few years ago, getting wrong predictions from a machine learning model used to be the norm. Nowadays, this has become the exception, and we’ve come to expect them to perform flawlessly, especially when they are deployed in real-world applications. An adversarial example is an input to a machine learning model that is intentionally designed by an attacker to fool the model into producing an incorrect output. Any machine learning model used in a real-world scenario is subject to adversarial attacks. An adversarial attack is a strategy aimed at causing a machine learning model to make a wrong prediction. It consists of adding a small and carefully designed perturbation to a clean image, that is imperceptible for the human eye, but that the model sees as relevant and changes its prediction.One can easily imagine the havoc that adversarial attacks can cause in real world scenarios. University of Washington researchers showed how easily self-driving cars can be fooled by just strategically putting some noisy stickers.CleverHans (https//github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) is a python library to benchmark machine learning systems’ vulnerability to adversarial examples. It provides standardized reference implementations of adversarial example construction techniques and adversarial training.

This is pretty much like using DNS for finding IP address of a site and then reaching that site using the IP address.Our entire architecture is split into multiple microservices which makes deployments easier, highly scalable and has better code quality. Key part of microservices architecture is inter communication amongst the microservices. We have architected in such a way that, the entire system is configurable according to the needs of a particular client per product/microservice. This demanded a central registry where all configurations of the microservices had to be in one place which is highly available. Hence, we designed and implemented a central service registry with Django, PostgreSQL and AWS Lambda. Any microservice will have to register itself in the system, define its own configs, subscribe to the notifications and communicate to other microservices using this registry. A wrapper library is also available for all microservices to use its features to avoid code being rewritten.Key points in developing our own service registry  It is a critical infrastructure component that must be setup, configured and managed with 99.9% uptimeAlthough respective microservices would cache the data provided by the service registry, if the service registry fails that data will eventually become out of date.

Python at the speed of light : Simulating Relativity using EinsteinPy,Shreyas Bapat (~shreyasbapat),"30 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/python-at-the-speed-of-light-simulating-relativity-using-einsteinpy~e1L3d/,Intermediate,Talks,Scientific Computing,"25 Aug 2019, 21:48",NA,"Brief DescriptionAs the ecosystem for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Python is growing at a very good rate, it still misses out a lot of people who want to understand and work in General Theory of Relativity. Each day, this theory is being proved by some fancy experiment. But when it comes to understanding it, we have very less tools available. Python is a language which enables a physicist/scientist to not think about the computation and focus on the results! This talk is about a new python package that intends to solve problems related to General Relativity. EinsteinPy (https//docs.einsteinpy.org) is a Python library which aims to solve problems focused on General Relativity.  Written in pure python, it can simulate the hardest problems mankind ever faced in just 4-5 lines of code! A problem of the precession of  perihelion of Mercury, which troubled Einstein for 15-20 years, can be solved using python in seconds! As we speak, new features are being added in the library like, simulation of binary black hole merger, symbolic calculations, visualisations of the hypersurfaces. EinsteinPy also enables a user to define different geometries of the space-time. It can also calculate trajectories of time like geodesics and hence can calculate relativistically  correct orbits!The talk will discuss how hard the problem was, how difficult it is to actually calculate/visualise it, and how we were able to do it using Python! The talk will also focus on how it will change the perception of General Relativity!Outline of the Talk1) Introduction to the problem. General Relativity is difficult, and it is difficult to appreciate the problem it solves. So, a basic understanding on that! (1/3 rd of the total time)2) Why Python!

A clinical chart of a patient is documented by a medical provider in SOAP(Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan) format.  Each segment in SOAP contains semantically related information. Subjective part of SOAP note contains history of a patient, Objective contains vital signs like BMI and BP, Assessment contains diagnosis given by the medical doctor and Plan contains medications prescribed etc.PurposeSegmentation of an unstructured chart in SOAP classes has many use case, One of the major use cases is to help medical practitioners review only relevant section of a clinical chart. This can save time while receiving large clinical charts of a patient.DatasetDataset contains unidentified 1000 clinical charts which are annotated by subject matter experts. Each chart is split into sentences and each sentence is annotated as per the SOAP class it belongs. A sentence which doesn’t belong to any SOAP class is annotated as NONSoap class.Proposed model This work was done using two approachesMachine Learning using Random Forest Algorithm, andDeep Learning using Spacy Text Categorizer.

CQ is aimed at automating a large part of manual code reviews, so software robustness and quality can be gated while saving developers time. The talk is aimed at understanding this evolution from the origin, learning from how the tools and processes have evolved, and how they fit into the context of modern software development.Continuous Quality or CQ is a software engineering practice in which isolated changes (or deltas) are immediately analyzed for the code’s quality and the properties of maintainability, and reported on before they are added to a code base. Just like CI and CD processes, CQ fits at the start of the software development workflow and helps in systematically ensuring quality of code base.This talk gives an introduction to CQ for the uninitiated, and dives deep into the need for systemising quality processes in a software project. We'll take examples of quality workflows from some of the most popular open-source projects and draw actionable lessons that can be applied to our own projects directly. Finally, we'll see how to bootstrap a new project with CQ, and how to gradually add it to a large existing codebase without getting overwhelmed.Topics coveredIntroduction to CQ, and it's need in modern software developmentLessons from popular open-source communities Django, Kubernetes, Elastic, ChromiumDeciding quality workflows and key metrics for your teamSetting up CQ on a new Python projectSetting up CQ on a large existing codebaseOutcomes Software developers (beginners and veterans alike) and engineering leaders can take away learnings about quality and security review processes from large-scale established projects, and get a fresh perspective of how they can apply these processes in their own projects.",There are no technical pre-requisites for the talk anyone who has experience in writing Python would draw value out of it.,Talk Slides (work in progress),"Sanket (@sanketsaurav) is co-founder at DeepSource.

Fetching data from APIs(GitHub) using Django and GraphQl without hitting the rate limits,Manaswini Das (~manaswinidas),"29 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/fetching-data-from-apisgithub-using-django-and-graphql-without-hitting-the-rate-limits~ego9e/,Beginner,Talks,Web development,"21 Jul 2019, 12:38",NA,"In this talk, I will present how I fetched data from GitHub API without hitting rate limits along with a walkthrough of my project and the pros of using GraphQl over REST in my project. In addition to this, I’ll also highlight various tools I have used to accomplish this and why I chose to add this data source and the tools. As far as GitHub API is concerned, the data which is to be pulled is already sorted and classified which makes it an excellent source for visualization. The data that is available includes meticulous information regarding pull requests, issues, activity feeds, repositories, organizations, etc, which is why I thought GitHub will be a relevant data source to add to Open Humans. My project is important because fetching data is troublesome when it comes to rate limits and taking care of the number of API calls, and will be helpful for both beginners and intermediate developers. I had developed this project as a part of my Outreachy internship with Open Humans Foundation. Open Humans Foundation provides a single platform to upload, connect and privately store data from a plethora of sources including 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Fitbit, Runkeeper and so on. My proposal included adding GitHub and Twitter data sources to this platform. The workflow of this project can be described as follows  A user goes to the website provided by this repo  A user signs up/signs in with Open Humans and authorizes the GitHub integration on Open HumansThis redirects the user back to this GitHub-integration websiteThe user is redirected starts the authorization with GitHub. For this, they are redirected to the Github pageAfter a user has authorized both Open Humans &amp; GitHub, their GitHub data will be requested and ultimately saved as a file in Open Humans.Regular updates of the data should be automatically triggered to keep the data on Open Humans up to date.The whole project uses Django to fetch data from the GitHub API. Now, fetching data has a couple of challengesThe GitHub API uses rate limits, which need to be respected and going over the rate limit would not yield more data but just errorsGetting all the data from Github takes a while, not only because of the rate limits but also because it can be a lot of dataFor this reason, this application makes good use of background tasks with Celery and the Python module requests_respectful, which keeps track of API limits by storing limits in a Redis database. As Redis is already used for Celery as well this does not increase the number of non-python dependencies. To exercise rate limiting, I came across requests_respectful, a wrapper that Open Humans is using in its API integrations. It is a rate-limiting wrapper built on top of Requests by SerpentAI. This enables users to work within rate limits(user rate limiting) of any amount of services simultaneously. Requests_respectful maximizes allowed requests without going over rate limits.Going through the API documentation, I found the v4 of GitHub API, also known as GraphQL API. GraphQL is a query language for your API, for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data and gives the power to request exactly the data that they need. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API and makes it easier to aggregate from multiple sources. GraphQL requests are POST requests to the GraphQL endpoint and the response is returned as JSON matching the query. Using GraphQL in Github API v4 has enabled me to easily extract required data in a single API call.Basic outline of the talkFacts about GitHub API, what are rate limits and challenges of fetching data from APIs[4-5 mins]Tools for rate limiting[2-3 mins]Celeryrequests_respectfulGraphQL and reasons for using GraphQL[3-4 mins]How does GraphQL work?[2-3 mins]How OAuth works?[2-3 mins]Workflow of the project and demo[5-6 mins]",Basics of Django and OAuth,GitHub repository https//github.com/manaswinidas/oh-github-sourceBlog post https//medium.com/outreachy-manaswini-das/graphql-for-building-github-source-2fed277c84c0Slides https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hejDhcNE_R5vThjLejN2TSMFULxSQenWx29GJx7WZ54/edit?usp=sharing,"Manaswini Das is an open source lover from Bhubaneswar, India.

However, these algorithms have not been tested on diverse datasets consisting of unusual but natural images. This makes such “human-level performance” models extremely susceptible to small perturbations of the inputs, highlighting the vast difference between the processing power of humans &amp; machines. Contrary to random noise, these perturbations are intelligently crafted and intentionally generated disturbances added to images in a dataset.  Given the wide-range use of neural networks in this AI boom, the vulnerability can have unprecedented effect if they get exploited in the real world.  The submission tries to answer whether the adversarial examples are simply a fun toy problem for researchers, or an example of a deeper, more chronic frailty in state-of-the-art image recognition architectures. The talk also expands on why is it difficult to defend against such attacks. This talk reaches out to all beginners, intermediate and expert audience in AI - asking them to raise questions in the field of AI security, and focusing on developing robust architectures and strengthening previously developed models against adversarial attacks.SESSION FLOWIntroduction - 5 minutes The session starts with why the topic focuses on fooling Neural Network particularly, and how convolutional neural networks achieved human like performance on various tasks in Computer Vision. I, then go on to intuitively explain what adversarial attacks mean, and why they are a critical problem in the AI pipeline.Adversarial Attacks - 10 minutes The next part focuses on the types of attacks (Targeted and Untargeted), and how simple machine learning concepts like gradient and saliency maps can be exploited to create adversarial attacks. I also expand on the trade-offs between these attacks, and how they represent different intuitions, when it comes to generating good attacks.Adversarial Defense &amp; What Next? - 10 minutes In the last part, the session focuses on why adversarial attacks are difficult to defend against, and what are some intuitive techniques that have proven to be effective against such attacks. It focuses on why and how students, engineers, researchers should focus on robustness, in addition to accuracy of their models.Slides Demo Video",Basic understanding of Python and a mind full of curiosity!,"This topic has been previously presented at AI Fest 2.0, Extended International Women's Day Summit by WTM, BVP, New Delhi and in a monthly meetup by Google Cloud Developer Group, New Delhi.

There are lot of records which can be duplicates or have the same entity references which leads to ambiguity and resource consumption.Entity resolution (ER) is the task of disambiguate records that correspond to real world entities across and within datasets. Problems associated with entity resolution are equally big — as the volume and velocity of data grow, inference across networks and semantic relationships between entities becomes increasingly difficult. Data quality issues, schema variations, and idiosyncratic data collection traditions can all complicate these problems even further.

This requires highly optimized algorithms - such as size, computation power, power consumption and memory. Modern Deep Learning algorithms tend to demand high numbers in all the aforementioned factors.In order to tackle this problem - several optimization paradigms have been suggested mainly divided into during and Post Training Optimization.In our talk, we will be presenting on how one could work on optimizing deep learning models for both these methods by talking about the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit, the techniques that will be covered include Post Training Quantization and Weight Pruning. Both these models aim to optimize models to reduce size, latency and power for negligible loss in accuracy. Post Training Quantization - Post-training quantization includes general techniques to reduce model size while also improving CPU and hardware accelerator latency with little degradation in model accuracy.Weight Pruning - Weight pruning means eliminating unnecessary values in the weights of the neural networks. While applying this technique, we are intelligently setting the neural network parameters’ values to zero to remove what we estimate are unnecessary connections.MorphNet - A recent development in the design of efficient neural network architectures, the philosophy is to essentially take existing models, and in one-shot, optimize it for the task at hand, for eg., Object Detection, Segmentation etc., this is done via a combination of the earlier mentioned methods.Outline3 min  Deep Learning Boom and Challenges in Deployment2 min  Need for Model Optimization1 min  Introduction to Methods of optimization5 min  Post Training Quantization4 min  Weight Pruning3 min  MorphNet7 min  TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit + Demo5 min  Q&amp;A",Intermediate proficiency in Python Intermediate knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural NetworksIntroductory knowledge of TensorFlow,SlidesModel Optimization ToolkitWeight Pruning MorphNet,"Niladri Shekhar DuttUndergraduate Researcher working in the field of Deep Learning and its applications in the field of Computer Vision and NLP.

Since it is capable to be rendered directly onto the browser.It has loads of advantages; Some of them are -  Browsers make the model more interactiveBrowsers have sensors, meaning they have access to the computer's speaker and microphone so tinkering with those via web becomes easyWide distribution (every internet user has a browser)Apart from these, Tensorflow.js has a very precise documentation and is pretty user friendly in nature. The best part is, since the library can be used directly with javascript, there's now no hassle to write a python model, wrap it in a flask server and deploy - which was the usual protocol earlier. Originated as deeplearn.js, it joined the tensorflow family  on March, 2018 which was announced at Tensorflow dev summit.It has support of over 32+ layers and has can help create neural networks with minimal syntax by the virtue of the layers API. It has become an amazing tool for implementing basic neural networks in web, making the process web developers absolutely hassle free.Tensorflow.js also makes it easier to serve models onto web for python users.

This high level of penetration gives us the opportunity of impacting the lives of millions by contributing in this field. This realization dawned on us sometime back and it led to the start of ""Mozart"", a project aimed at making the voice assistants personalized by empowering them with the ability to understand a person’s emotions.Imagine you had a hard day at work, you reach home and want to enjoy some music. You ask your voice assistant to play some music and it starts playing the most popular songs. But these may not necessarily be suited for your mood. The exhausting day at work has put you in a low mood. You want some music which lifts your mood up. How great would it be if the voice assistant is smart enough to tap onto your emotion and play music accordingly? Our project is a simple materialization of a great concept. It can be expanded to something big like helping out people afflicted with emotional problems.Our purpose of giving this talk is to encourage new ideas in this direction and share the lessons that we have learnt while working on this project. In our talk we'll be touching upon the below given topics and explaining them with the help of our project.Importance of demystifying sentiments/emotions In this section, we’ll share what motivated us to pick up this problem and what will be the magnitude of impact of solving it.Deep Learning, Python and their magical powers We’ll touch upon why and how Deep Learning is a saviour in scenarios like this.

In this section, we’ll compare various deep learning algorithms (majorly CNN, RNN) and implementation libraries using different design aspects.Key Learnings It’s the experience sharing section! We’ll talk about the challenges we faced, mistakes we made and what all we learnt in our journey. Major focus will be on sharing tips related to tuning of models using techniques like K-fold cross validation and Grid Search in Python. Demo We’ll demo the Alexa skill which we built.

We live in an age of mass surveillance, and big data, mixed with the ever-increasing power of artificial intelligence, means all of our actions are being recorded and stored like never before. Surveillance is being used to make people safe, but how much privacy are we willing to give up to be safe? That’s where “Adversarial Attack” comes into the picture.To introduce participants to “Adversarial Attack” - which looks like a random pattern but can trick the ML models and cause the incorrect output of the model, we’ll use this demo.

Python as the third language in the Three Language Formula,Cr Sundar (~cr),"25 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/python-as-the-third-language-in-the-three-language-formula~e9M3e/,Intermediate,Talks,Culture and society,"22 Jul 2019, 15:53",NA,"I wish to propose that Python should be considered as the third language in our Three Language Formula.    The modern times are internet based. Almost everything is run and maintained on line and one is not far away from the world wide web at any time. In the years to come the influence of internet on our lives is only going to increase many folds. Under these circumstances it is necessary that our future generations must be familiar with internet languages, coding and writing programs that can run on various table top and hand held devices.    Therefore it is essential that we include the teaching of computer languages in our education systems.    The Ministry of Education has since 1968 been harping on a 'three language formula'. At the outset it must be agreed that a three language formula is suitable for a diverse country like ours. However we find that through the decades the policy has failed.    The reason for this is successive governments have erred in the choice of languages. They have rightly given the first and second place in the formula to regional languages and English. It is in the choice of the third language that they have gone wide off the mark.    For the third language they have said that non-Hindi states should take on Hindi as the third language. Hindi is strongly opposed by non-Hindi states as an imposition of a language upon them. On the other hand Hindi states only pay lip service to other Indian languages as the third language. Therefore the present form of three language formula has been a success.    However, the Three Language Formula could find acceptance by all States of our country if, keeping with modern times, we choose a Computer Language such as Python as the third language. This will increase the computer literacy in our country which is a prerequisite for the future.    The main advantage of Python is that it is an Open Source and Community Developed language that is easy to learn and has support available. It has a user-friendly Data Structure, it is beneficial for productivity and speed.    It is a superb language for teaching programming both at the introductory and in the more advanced courses. There are many courses that teach basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials.    Python is used in many applications and domains. It is widely used in scientific and numeric computations. It is the preferred language for Artificial Intelligence.

Writing a BitTorrent engine - powered by asyncIO,arpit. oberoi (~arpit.),"25 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/writing-a-bittorrent-engine-powered-by-asyncio~e7KAe/,Intermediate,Talks,Core Python,"20 Jul 2019, 14:00",NA,"NOTE I say BitTorrent ENGINE and not a client because it is not your average libtorrent client, it's a BEP compliant asynchronous BitTorrent engine written from scratch, in python, powered by asyncIO.AsyncIO is a python library released as a part of standard library in python 3.5.It is powered by an event loop that supports uvloop, which is a cython wrapper over libuv,The same library that powers node.js.3 releases later, asyncIO has still not been accepted by the larger half of the community.The problem being the absence of obvious use cases and therefore the sheer lack of interest.The asyncIO library came out boasting of IO performance comparable to node.js and goroutines but in 'make 10^N web requests' benchmarks which doesn't intrigue everybody except maybe someone who wants to take a website down.Finding new asynchronous alternates for all your favorite libraries(requests) isn't fun either.The microservices, RESTful, basically any interactor based architectural patterns won't make it any easier.In this talk i will demonstrate how making some design choices and understanding the real reason why your traditional approach to some problems might not work out when you start out with asyncIO.Basic outline of the talkHow single threaded IO achieves the performance it boasts [4-5 minutes]Common roadblocks on the way to asynchronous awesomeness [5 minutes]Why asynchronous, Favorable vs Forced use cases [4-5 minutes]How projects like aiohttp and sanic do what they do to achieve what they achieve [2 minutes]BitTorrent, the ideal candidate for this talk [5-10] minutesEvent driven architecture [5 minutes]Q/A [2-5 minutes]Who is this talk for ?People who don't want to create a separate node.js/golang microservice every time they see IOPS heavy use cases.Key takeawaysSolution designEvent driven architectureWriting beautiful asynchronous abstractionsDetailsAddressing the elephant in the room, Why BitTorrent ?Simple answer Because it looked complicated and challenging myself to do this would result in me spending some quality time with asyncIOReal answer Some of the main operations performed by a Bit Torrent engine are downloading data, writing to disk, reading from disk and uploading data. All these operations are Network IO or Disk IO operations which makes it a perfect candidate for asyncIO.Bit Torrent was something i was always interested in, reading wiki articles to understand how it works and does what it does. Everything about Bit torrent, from binary encoded metadata files to Peer wire protocol and finally to some extensions that are worth mentioning here, like mainline DHT, everything has always attracted me towards it.Implementing a protocol from scratch was on the bucket list for quite a long time now and Bit Torrent being a perfect AsyncIO candidate just made it happen.Note This talk extends ahmed abdalla's talk and fixes/completes his Bit Torrent implementation using asyncIO",PythonNetworking basicsP2P basicsBitTorrent basics,https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EH2XGwCm4C8SPhlbz26lBCjlM31nOoMJUcC0-NDG8dA/edit?usp=sharinghttp//github.com/supersaeyan/bittorpy,"Arpit Oberoi has been a python developer for more than 4 years now and has been professionally designing scalable solutions for a more than a year.Areas of interestLinux enthusiast  ProudParselTongue(python)Performance oriented python(cython, asyncio)Always interested in clean code practices, scalable architecture designs, design patterns, style guides",EMAIL arpitkoberoi@gmail.com | arpit.oberoi@cloudsek.comBlogsBlog post 1 https//medium.com/@arpitkoberoi/cyberoam-bot-871441a2418fBlog post 2 https//medium.com/@arpitkoberoi/fortinet-bot-d90fdb08b25eBlog post 3 https//medium.com/@arpitkoberoi/latest-tv-show-episodes-and-where-to-find-them-59288224528bSOCIALShttps//github.com/supersaeyan/https//medium.com/@arpitkoberoihttps//mobile.twitter.com/Arpit_Saeyanhttps//www.facebook.com/supersaeyanhttps//www.instagram.com/really_bad_influence/

Machine Translation is a tool that facilitates and enhances the spread of knowledge and build better conversations.In recent years, with the exponential growth in Deep Learning, Machine Translation system has moved from Statistical Based Models to Neural Models. LSTMs were first introduced in 1997, but it is in the 5-6 years where its potential has been utilised. This is because of increase in computation power and abundance in data. LSTM's allow processing of sequential data. This has been the building block for solving many problems like Text Summarisation, Building Chatbots, generating captions for images, Machine Translation etc.   In this problem, we will use a Encoder-Decoder Architecture .The encoder reads an input sequence and generates a single output vector. The Decoder then reads this output vector to produce the output sequence. This kind of architecture is commonly used when both the input and output are sequences.

Machine learning on the run: Optimized feature engineering for streaming timeseries data in industrial automation,mprasoon,"23 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/machine-learning-on-the-run-optimized-feature-engineering-for-streaming-timeseries-data-in-industrial-automation~dPonb/,Intermediate,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","25 Jul 2019, 22:31",NA,"With the emergence of large scale industrial IoT systems, large volume of telemetry data is being collected and stored at high frequency. Many of the industrial processes are being automated with sensors and control systems, which along with the manufacturing execution systems(MES) generate large volumes of data; collected through a large number of sensors, deployed in the product line. This data must be processed in near real time. Under the domain of industry 4.0, the data is time series and the processing include stream ingestion, ETL (Extraction, Transform and Loading) and data preprocessing for machine learning. Machine learning model deployments are for fault detection, predictive maintenance, root cause analysis to name a few, to be followed by complex event processing (CEP).There are multiple challenges for data engineering in the case of large scale industrial IoT systemsLatency For sampling rates in the order of a few milli-seconds, data has to be processed at similar rates to ensure that the time lag between the raw data intake and data processing is minimal.Interdependence Many times, the result of one model or a transform is dependent on another. Thus, different sampling rates or sudden changes in data streams may lead to delays in computation.Granularity The data from multiple sensors come in varied granularity. This has to be accounted for when creating the feature engineering system.Volume of data Typically the volume of data is very large. It could easily be upto 500M data points in a day from 100s of 1000s of deployed sensors with 10K – 30K machine learning models running in real time.In this talk, the speaker is going to talk about a crucial component of data preparation for machine learning deployments which optimizes data processing for machine learning readiness or a complex event processing. The central idea is to use extended semantic graphs with parallel computation of independent transformations to optimise for faster throughput on data stream. Semantic graphs provide a great way for feature engineering because of its advantages in code refactoring and traceability to name a few. Adding parallelism allows us to be able to run parallel threads that optimise the time required for data preprocessing.

Building Automation Tools for Mechanical/Structural Analysis and Pre-Processing with HyperMesh/SolidWorks/CATIA,theflyingrahul,"22 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/building-automation-tools-for-mechanicalstructural-analysis-and-pre-processing-with-hypermeshsolidworkscatia~aKjne/,Beginner,Talks,Scientific Computing,"20 Aug 2019, 22:16",NA,"TCL or Tool Command Language is very popular among mechanical engineers and CAE/CAM experts.Today, all the industries rely on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results to validate their product's structural integrity. Based on the FEA results, the product design is finalized and drawings are prepared for production.Problems faced in Finite Element AnalysisThe problem with FEA is the time spent behind pre-processing of model. To perform FEA on any object, a large number of load-combinations and load-steps have to be defined in HyperMesh. This is a very time consuming process for any analyst. When such analysis is done in an industrial level, it involves a large number of elements in a single body. Also for performing correlation testing between FEM analysis and experimental results, engineers have to spend a considerable amount of time to organize and validate data.Generating load-combinations and load-steps manually caused many errors and was very time consuming as the number of combinations and cases are very large.During my internship at Bombardier Transporatation, I had developed a tool with Python to solve this problem by automating the data cleansing and data feed process by taking input from MS Excel sheets, preparing which is less time consuming.Magnitude of the problemOn average, creating a load combination in HyperMesh takes about 20 seconds for a pro-user with a fast enough computer. Imagine the time it takes to define 50,000-1,50,000 load combinations in the CAE software. This pre-processing task alone can take approximately 1500 days for a single person. The same applies to the process of defining load steps also. There is a probability that errors might creep in as this is a totally manual task.Also, the HyperMesh software itself is quite buggy. Trying to modify a property/attribute of an object in HyperMesh doesn't work well. The updating has to be done at least twice via the GUI for the change to reflect. This bug hasn't been solved for years. The updating issue is not seen when scripts are used instead of the HyperMesh GUI.Python is our savior!This task can be automated by using TCL (Tool Control Language) script, which is the only script that is recognized by the Altair HyperWorks. This script also works on a variety of simulation softwares like Dassault Systems SolidWorks and CATIA. The Python code takes the inputs from a CSV file containing the load case combinations in a pre-set format and generates a TCL script. The TCL script when executed in HyperWorks, generates the required load cases automatically.It might appear a little easy to build such an tool, but the problem had its own challenges...Upgrading an existing prototypeMigrating from CSV to Excel WorkbookInterpreting TCL scripts (I was new to FEA then!)Being choosy - PyQt or wx? / OpenPyXl or xlrd?During this talk, I'll walk you through my experience in building this automation tool.Rinsing our data and preparing it for export to TCL scriptGetting started with PyQtBuilding rich-UI to deliver the best experience for my fellow mechanical engineers (Yeah I made their lives easier!)Error reporting (because IT people can't assist all the time!)Optimizing performance for large datasets (because power is priceless...)Sticking to the Zen of PythonPython for a reason...Rich collection of librariesPainless UI designEasier to code (and for someone else to read as well)and the obvious reason...Cross Platform. 100% Guaranteed!The company uses different operating systems.

In short as the tagline states - The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.We all love django ORM and the amazing features it brings to the plate. But there is a little unexplored territory of DJango ORM, remains unknown to a many developers. It is  Django Contenttype framework, which we might have heard of but never used it. If you thought as the name suggests, it must be something to do with the asset management fields like Imagefield, etc (atleast thats what I thought when I first heard of it), then you are wrong. So lets look at an example to learn about it.Suppose you have an application in which the user can add both Posts and Pictures. Now you want to create a feature where users can comment on the posts or pictures. So generally we think there are 2 approaches, either you create 2 different tables PostComments and PictureComments which would have respective foreign key relationships, or else you create a single table Comments which has two different columns for foreign key relationship for Post and Pictures. Now what if I tell you there is third option. Introducing Django ContenttypeDjango contenttype is the solution where you don't need to create two different foreign keys neither use different Comment tables, rather you can take advantage of the generic interface to create link between the tables. And this is highly beneficial since tomorrow if you have another segment called Quotes then you can you the same existing table and to add comments support to the new segment. One of the biggest advantages of using contenttype framework is that it lets you use all the existing Django ORM features and everything is in the django application layer.Talk OutlineIntroduction about the author and description of the scenario as explained above [3-4 min]Different approaches which can be taken (different model, different foreign key) [ 2 min]Introduction to django contenttype, generic foreign key and how it can help [ 3-4 min]Example of how to implement django contenttype in a model [5-6 min]Show how to access django contenttype relationships and take advantage of the django ORM when using contenttype [8-10 min]Usecases for django content type [ 1-2 min ]Q/A [ 2 min]Takeaways from the talkUnderstanding of django contenttype frameworkWhen to use contenttype frameworkUsing generic foreign key / contenttype framework in django models.",Basic web development experience.Understanding of django models and django ORM.,"Slides Presentation slides (Draft) Slides would be used as code reference, most of the content would be spoken or demonstrated live using django shell.","Arghya(argo) is a senior backend developer at Healthifyme.

Gene Editing Technology: CRISPR-Cas9,Jyothirmayee,"19 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/gene-editing-technology-crispr-cas9~enqld/,Intermediate,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","25 Aug 2019, 22:32",NA,"By creating a machine-learning algorithm that predicts how human and mouse cells respond to CRISPR-induced breaks in DNA, a team of researchers discovered that cells often repair broken genes in ways that are precise and predictable, sometimes even returning mutated genes back to their healthy version. In addition, the researchers put this predictive power to the test and successfully corrected mutations in cells taken from patients with one of two rare genetic disorders.The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a microbial adaptive immune system, was recently exploited for modulating DNA sequences within the endogenous genome in many organisms. This system has emerged as a technology of choice for genome editing with promising therapeutic and research advancements. However, these exciting developments were not paralleled by deep understanding of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage efficiency. Indeed, while numerous studies have been conducted in order to define better guidelines to determine CRISPR-Cas9 specificity, much ambiguity remains surrounding its mechanism of action. Here, we present a machine-learning based algorithm that was trained on genome-wide experimental data. The algorithm considers a broad range of features that describe different attributes that potentially impact the cleavage efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 including genomic attributes, RNA thermodynamics, and those concerning sequence similarity. These result in a predictive model that can be used both to predict the cleavage propensity of a new genomic site according to the genomic context, as well as to learn on the importance of different features on CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency and selectivity.",Machine learning model understandingBasic Biology understanding,"Slideshttps//drive.google.com/open?id=1In5xx2xI2TeOPvy7l5U6ww_YEfTHVrzoStructure of the TalkWhy and Goal of using DL in GenomicsGuinness Record (Whole Genome Sequencing in 19.5hrs)Need for Gene Editing TechniquesBrief history Technology making Headlines,Introduction to CRISPR-Cas9 technologyIssues with the Technology,On-site errorRegression with Boosting,Off-site errorNaïve BayesCRISPR Clinical TrialsImportant Linkshttps//journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005807https//www.nature.com/articles/s41551-017-0178-6https//www.broadinstitute.org/videos/machine-learning-based-crispr-guide-designhttps//www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/crispr/","Seven years of work experience with biotechnology giant Novozymes A/S as Senior Technology Innovation Specialist.

You plugged in an integer where something expected a string. The function only expected 3 arguments. This import failed. That key does not exist. The number of elements in the two lists isn’t equal. In addition, it’s often possible to create unit tests for a certain functionality.This is just a start when it comes to training neural nets. Everything could be correct syntactically, but the whole thing isn’t arranged properly, and it’s really hard to tell. The ""possible error surface"" is large, logical (as opposed to syntactic), and very tricky to unit test. For example, perhaps you forgot to flip your labels when you left-right flipped the image during data augmentation. Your net can still (shockingly) work pretty well because your network can internally learn to detect flipped images and then it left-right flips its predictions. Or maybe your autoregressive model accidentally takes the thing it’s trying to predict as an input due to an off-by-one bug. Or you tried to clip your gradients but instead clipped the loss, causing the outlier examples to be ignored during training. Or you initialized your weights from a pretrained checkpoint but didn’t use the original mean. Or you just screwed up the settings for regularization strengths, learning rate, its decay rate, model size, etc.Therefore, your misconfigured neural net will throw exceptions only if you’re lucky; Most of the time it will train but silently work a bit worse.OutlineData Augmentation in images and text [4-5 Mins]How to apply different pre-processing techniques [4-5 Mins]How to perform weight initialization [4-5 Mins] Understand how regularization can prevent Overfitting [4-5 Mins]How to tune parameters smarter and quicker [4-5 Mins]QnA [4-5 Mins]OutcomeThe talk should usher you with all the major ingredients for successfully training Neural Networks.",Basic familiarity with deep learning concepts.

The application infrastructure is defined in code by defining needed components like compute instances, storage buckets, networks, load-balancers, firewalls, etc. Terraform will then take this blueprint and plan how to reach the desired state defined in the code. This also allows TerraForm to do incremental changes by comparing the defined (changed) state with the deployed (current) state and execute only the needed changes. We simply create a  file (or multiple files) with the .tf extension and defining all the components we need. We can choose to split the files up by the components they defined (network, compute,  Ansible, etc.).AnsibleAnsible is an open-source, IT automation engine that executes repetitive system administration tasks such as provisioning and deployment.OutlineWhat is terraform?What is Ansible?Why Terraform?Deploy a basic application using Terraform and Ansible on AWS.ResourcesRelevant AudienceDevelopers who want to deploy an application to AWS by only making use of code.",Basic idea of Amazon web services and Ansible,Slides,Currently Software Engineer at Essentia SoftServ.

Intent is to present simple methods to query Jenkins' REST API using Python's 'requests' package; this is not part of the standard library set and should be installed separately. This talk will showcase how to combine the 'requests' package and the REST API, provided by Jenkins, to automate the collection of data that's essential to know the health of a given project. We will begin with confirming the access to the publicly accessible instance of TYPO3's Chef CI Jenkins. This will be followed by presenting code snippets to list all the top-level projects, query specific projects in the top-level project, collect all the subprojects that map to the respective GitHub repository in TYPO3-cookbooks org. For each subproject, collect data about the active branch build jobs, and combine this data to prepare reports, communicate health status to stakeholders.In the conclusion, further areas of automation shall be presented, like, means to monitor build agents, ways to identify and purge obsolete builds, visual representation of project data using Jupyter notebook, and packages like, numpy and matplotlib.","Python programming experienceBasic knowledge about the popular HTTP package, requests.Familiarity with any version of open source automation server, Jenkins","Draft slides and a short video can be accessed here, link",Ram pursues to be active contributor to open source by way of contributing articles to various magazines.,https//opensourceforu.com/2018/05/integration-of-a-simple-docker-workflow-with-jenkins-pipeline/https//opensourceforu.com/2017/12/get-started-with-jenkins-2-0-pipeline-as-code/https//www.pressreader.com/australia/linux-format/20160929/281625304780496

It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. However, when working with excessively large amounts of data, Pandas on a single core becomes insufficient and people have to resort to different distributed systems to increase their performance.The trade-off for improved performance, however, comes with a steep learning curve. Essentially users probably just want Pandas to run faster and aren’t looking to optimize their workflows for their particular hardware setup. This means people want to use the same Pandas script for their 10KB dataset as their 10TB dataset. Modin offers to provide a solution by optimizing pandas so that Data Scientists spend their time extracting value from their data than on tools that extract data.Through this talk we will learn how to use Ray to scale new and existing Python code. It will cover the Ray system architecture, example applications, GPU support, and best practices. We cover the underlying architecture of Modin and how it is able to scale Pandas data frames for huge data sets.

Some of the archaic data in few domains still exist in paper based models viz., Insurance, Healthcare, Education etc. Extracting &amp; Digitizing data from those paper based documents and forms has always been a difficult problem to solve. A few reasons why, is due to the sheer variance in document structure/layout/data. A few scribbles with a pen or pencil adds an additional dimension of complexity.Many companies tackle this problem manually which makes it even more challenging as it is a slow process and highly expensive. One approach is to cluster the documents based on the template of documents and write rules to extract required content. The flipside of this approach is, If document deviates from the expected template the defined rules would not work.This talk will briefly cover the approach to solve these problems by automatically extracting text and data from documents (scanned pdfs, word/excel files) without user’s manual effort. We will also discuss some common problems that arise during information extraction. This talk is helpful in multiple domains like Insurance, Health Care, Education etc. Since they have huge amount of data within which they need to filter only the required data and discard remainingWe will demonstrate how this problem can be solved in an easy and scalable manner. Our current approach can understand data, identify tables and extract information as key-value pairs based on context. Our approach can extract default entities like Name, Date, Address, Unique Identifier, Amount and also User defined custom entities.

Whereas using something like Rust would make the process much easier because it both offers better Safety and Tooling that allows for rapid development of small oxidization modules to the code for increasing the performance overall.Also libraries PyO3 provide a very unintrusive way of adding Rust Modules to your Python Project.

Unified Data Processing with Apache Beam,Raj Rakesh (~raj84),"03 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/unified-data-processing-with-apache-beam~bkk5b/,Beginner,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","26 Jun 2019, 13:43",NA,"Currently, some popular data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark consider batch and stream processing jobs differently ( Spark and Spark Streaming). The APIs across different processing systems such as Apache Spark or Apache Flink are also different. This forces the end user to learn a potentially new system every time. Apache Beam addresses this problem by providing a unified programming model that can be used for both batch and streaming pipelines. The Beam SDK allows the user to execute these pipelines against different execution engines ( may be Spark Cluster or Google Cloud Dataflow etc.)Through this talk, we start off by providing an overview of Apache Beam using the Python SDK and the problems it tries to address from an end user’s perspective. We cover the core programming constructs in the Beam model such as PCollections, ParDo, GroupByKey, windowing, and triggers. We describe how these constructs make it possible for pipelines to be executed in a unified fashion in both batch and streaming. Then we use examples to demonstrate these capabilities. The examples showcase using Beam for stream processing and real-time data analysis, and how Beam can be used for feature engineering in some Machine Learning applications using Tensorflow.

Problems include handling the scale, efficient resource utilization, version controlling the data. With the highly optimized RedisAI, super flexible PyTorch and heavily organized Hangar, all the sleepless nights are stories of the past.Even with the advancement, the community had made in the past couple of years, problems of a DL engineer starts right from the beginning when they think about version controlling the data and model. None of the toolset available right now could make a platform ""git"" had provided for programmers years ago. With the entry of Hangar and it's python APIs, we are now moving ahead of the game. Having a version controlling system like hangar in place, DL folks are still struggling with production deployment with their framework of choice. PyTorch is the most flexible and easy framework that all deep learning developers had loved. But without a plug n play deployment toolkit, PyTorch always suffered to attract people who want to deploy their model to production. Meanwhile, RedisAI is trying to solve the problem every deep learning engineer faces especially when they try to scale. Making sure the production environment is highly available is probably the most daunting task DevOps experts worried especially when they have a deep learning service in production. I'll be presenting the killer combo of PyTorch and RedisAI and explain how can we develop super optimized DL model with LibTorch but without losing the flexibility provided by PyTorch and how to ship it to production without even worried about writing a wrapper service for the model. Not just that, I'll be showing how to put this deployment into a multi-node cluster and make sure you have 100% availability always.In a nutshell, the talk covers a deep learning workflow by introducing three toolkits for the user that makes the whole pipeline seamless.Talk outlineIntroduction to modern world deep learning workflowProblems with the existing toolkits in the ecosystemSolving the problemsHangar Building reliable data pipelineSaving data as tensorsManaging conflicts, branching, mergingCLI and Python APIsPyTorch Ideating, designing and building the model architectureFirst steps with PyTorchData loader for loading data from the hangar repositoryTraining and exporting the model using redisai-pyRedisAI Trained models can be pushed to a highly scalable Redis environmentLoading exported pytorch model using redisai-pyServing the model at scaleHigh availability using sentinel",The audience should have basic python knowledge and a brief understanding of deep learning.,Medium post on RedisAISlides,"I am working as a part of the development team of [Tensor]werk, an infrastructure development company focusing on deep learning deployment problems.

However, an interaction with the volunteers and NGO's working in disaster relief revealed that there is a lack of co-ordination and misinformation efforts. We created a semi-automated platform which leverages social networks to identify important information  in a crowd-sourced manner. Matches for resources are then suggested in an automated fashion, however we allow human supervision to dictate matches, thus making it easy to use for any and all NGO's and organizations working in Disaster mitigation. We implemented a real-time location identification system from microblogs which was 100 times faster than existing state of art tools available, like Stanford NLP. For location identification, we compared our algorithm's performance with StanfordNLP and Spacy's NER tagged, along with a few naive approaches. We preprocessed tweets and used Hashtag segmentation, Proper Noun disambiguation, pattern based regex matching, observing distances between disaster words in the dependency parsed trees to obtain a set of candidate locations - which are then verified using gazetteers.

The burning of fossil fuels contributes to 82% of Greenhouse gases released into the environment. Switching to electric vehicles will go a long way in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and the consequent emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, there are many reasons why people are reluctant to use electric vehicles. Our main purpose was to look for ways in which we can promote the use of electric vehicles. [HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]The talk will involve estimating the energy that will be consumed by the electric vehicle during the journey from source to destination and additionally we will also estimate the amount of time the journey will take to complete while factoring in the time required to recharge the electric vehicle. We also predicted the amount of CO2 that will be saved from being emitted into the environment thus increasing the awareness about electric vehicles and CO2 emission. [HTML_REMOVED]This Route option module focuses on leveraging human knowledge to get the best route. At a given time, due to certain circumstances (like rush hour) it is possible that a certain route may be faster than a route shown on the map. People who travel at those times or people who are residents of those areas have more knowledge about which route should be taken at what time. If every person entered which path to be taken based on their experience we could create a database that will help us to predict which path should be taken. Wouldn't you like to see a map of all the places that you have explored in your electric vehicle so far? That is what the visualisation module is about. Using data sampling and machine learning the path taken by the vehicle has been visualised.The route prediction module helps to predict the route that the car will take based on the previous history. Wouldn't you like your map to automatically predict the path with least traffic? Wouldn't it be awesome if your map showed you the path to be taken after checking where other cars are going to go? This is what module is about. Based on the initial few points and the previous history, it will predict the route that the car will take, thus helping to determine the predicted congestion and helping in routing the electric cars better.",Basic knowledge of Machine Learning[HTML_REMOVED]Awareness about electric vehicles[HTML_REMOVED]A desire to save planet Earth by going green![HTML_REMOVED],Slides https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j_xTRjSz40sqvGRxQdRcpu05gSAnJWYkXX19v5lkj1M/edit?usp=sharing,"Mashrin is passionate about data science, algorithms and graphs and is presently in the final year pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology.

Speed up your Python modules using Nim,Anirudh (~icyphox),"22 Apr, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/speed-up-your-python-modules-using-nim~ej9ld/,Intermediate,Talks,Core Python,"22 Apr 2019, 21:59",NA,"If this title looks familiar to you, it’s because there was a similar talk last year, titled “Speed up your Python modules using Rust”. This talk draws inspiration from it, and aims to introduce a new systems programming language — Nim. We all love Python, but we have to agree that it sucks when it comes to writing performant code. Sure, you could write your code in C/C++, or perhaps even Rust. You can even use Python's ctypes module to interface with foreign functions defined in dynamic libs generated by C/C++ or Rust.All of this comes at a cost the need to write code in a low level language, or in the case of Rust, the need to learn new (and perhaps, a tad complex) syntax.Enter Nim, a new fast and efficient systems programming language, that's compiled, statically typed and offers C-like speed. But the one feature that seals the deal — elegant and more importantly, Pythonic syntax. Don't believe me?

With the explosion in the number of road-vehicles, the surge in traffic density (especially in metropolitan cities like Bangalore and Delhi) has become a major cause of concern. It has, therefore, become really important to develop Intelligent traffic signals and systems in order to optimize the escalating traffic flow. For a developing country like India where the majority of motorists are still negligent of traffic laws and are often seen breaking them, for e.g, driving in opposite lanes, violating an indicator near turns and turning in a wrong direction, and many more such instances which eventually lead to traffic jams. In such Indian scenarios, the power of reinforcement learning applied on traffic behavior can be leveraged to greatly reduce these traffic jams.

However sometimes it becomes difficult to automatically process this huge amount of video data even for simple tasks such as object counting due to the size and velocity of the data. All of us can appreciate applications of object counting algorithms in parking lots for calculating net available space, in public spaces for vehicle counting and or in factories for process and production monitoring.But how easy it is to cook up a Python application for the same? Object detection can be easily done by using pre-trained models, however object counting requires to dig a little deeper to obtain satisfactory results. If you have ever tried building an object counting application in Python then you would know how difficult it is to count objects across different frames of a video. OpenCV supports several object tracking algorithms, which are fairly accurate.

Blocking or removal of objectionable content involving minors in an attempt to reduce child abuse,Mashrin Srivastava (~Mashrin_Srivastava),"31 Aug, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/blocking-or-removal-of-objectionable-content-involving-minors-in-an-attempt-to-reduce-child-abuse~e3Vpd/,Intermediate,Talks,Others,"31 Aug 2017, 22:37",23,"The talk will be on the classification and removal of the offensive content which involves children, with a plan to extend it in a way that an extension can be developed. Websites and browsers can implement this to filter out any such content at the time of upload.Removal of such content, will lead to a scenario of decreased child abuse and sexual harassment as the content uploaded by the assaulter will be blocked at that instance and hence, such shameful acts might get reduced as in this case, one will not be able to access their content, thus nullifying their motto. Identifying and classifying offensive or adult content is an important problem which researchers have tackled for decades. With the evolution of computer vision and deep learning, algorithms have matured and are now able to classify an image with greater precision. Since images and user generated content dominate the internet today, filtering nudity and other objectionable adult contents become an important problem. Using a deep CNN with residual connections, the model will quickly classify each second of a video into different categories, further also predict an expected age for the said content. Then it uses the same classification to automatically edit the video as per the government rules in that geographical area. It can remove all the scenes containing objectionable content.The proposed model on which the talk will be focused will be using a Convolution neural network with residual connections pre-trained on on ImageNet. The model will be iteratively fine tuned to enhance the accuracy. For the removal of the offensive content by cutting it out can be done in a way that with the predictions for a frame each second, it will take the argmax of those predictions and will create cut blocks of the content or video where the offensive content score is greater than some threshold. The threshold will be flexible, so that along with the classification, we can determine whether the content needs to be removed or not, according to the geographical location. The CNN will also classify the people on the basis gender and on the basis of age- as minor or adults.","The basic idea about what Deep Learning is.Current state of affairs regarding online interaction and abuse.An urge to bring in a change in the ""digital society"" and the motivation to contribute towards what's right!",Slides https//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iUGZWL4tgYemDVZbSa3tC68SSP7co3gtX1mzL7aTIug/edit?usp=sharing,"Mashrin is passionate about data science, algorithms and graphs and is presently in the final year pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology.

The goal of this talk is to make the audience familiar with adversarial examples and how they can trick/fool even a fully trained Deep Neural Network (DNN). Data Scientist and Researchers all over the world are spending a lot of time in solving this problem and coming out with their ideas and solutions. Adversarial Examples has challenged and raised a question in everyone's mind. Is it safe to implement AI in the real world? Because as long as DNN can be tricked there will always be misuse/misbehavior of such technology. For example, if we implement an autonomous driving system in a car.We have trained it to detect red and green signals using Object Detection and Image Recognition. But someone changes the red signal in such a way, which is not detected by human eye, that it appears as a green signal then it may cause an accident. This will create a total chaos in the real world if misused.While it is easy to trick a neural network by just changing weights in back-propagation, it is quite difficult to find a solution for such abnormality.There are many ideas like adversarial training and other defensive training, but there is no real time solution as such.

Several data analysis techniques in the modern day involve the use of networks for their effective operation, the well renowned social network analysis being one of them. With such advances and the increased importance of networks, there is a need for proper ways to visualize the computed networks as well as share it and share the results of the analysis of the network with other collaborators.GraphSpace is a web based platform that enables users to upload, share and interact with their graphs. The platform is widely used and preferred by research groups to collaborate and work on their networks. GraphSpace allows users to easily upload richly-annotated networks irrespective of the algorithms or software used to generate them. It facilitates users to create and manage groups in order to work collaboratively on networks and also has the feature of making networks public which can be explored by other users. GraphSpace provides the users with advanced search options like search by tags, node or edge names.The workshop will start with an introduction to GraphSpace web-platform and familiarize attendees with its main features like uploading and working on networks. Then we will use the NetworkX package and the graphspace_python package to demonstrate the ease with which a researcher can upload networks to GraphSpace programmatically. We will also showcase how to convert your offline boring NetworkX networks into online interactive graphs with visually appealing features. At the end of the workshop, attendees will learn how to integrate GraphSpace into their network analysis projects using the graphspace_python library and use it for seamless collaboration and dissemination of their results.What this workshop coversUsing GraphSpace as a collaborative tool and a cloud store for networks     [HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Uploading and visualizing networks[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Working on graph layouts[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Sharing graphs with groups[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Publishing graphs[HTML_REMOVED]     [HTML_REMOVED]Introduction to NetworkX and graphspace_python packageUsing graphspace_python package      [HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Creating and uploading graphs[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Laying out nodes and edges programmatically[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Specifying weights on edges[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Adding style to the networks[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Working with graph layouts[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Specifying node positions[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Styling graph elements[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]Managing groups and sharing graphs[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Creating groups[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Adding/Removing group members[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Sharing graphs with groups[HTML_REMOVED]               [HTML_REMOVED]Publishing graphs for public viewing[HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]     [HTML_REMOVED]Demonstrating a use case      [HTML_REMOVED]           [HTML_REMOVED]A small tutorial on a real world dataset.[HTML_REMOVED]      [HTML_REMOVED]",Basic familiarity with Graphs,Notebooks used at ICSB 2017 - 18th International Conference on   Systems Biology @ Virginia USAGraphSpace Manualgraphspace_python Repositorygraphspace_python Manual,"I (Sandeep Mahapatra) am a fourth year Computer Science undergrad student at College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar.

Real World Numba: Taking the Path of Least Resistance,Ankit Mahato (~ankit60),"27 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/real-world-numba-taking-the-path-of-least-resistance~dygVa/,Beginner,Talks,Scientific Computing,"01 Sep 2019, 22:47",NA,"“Use a screwdriver instead of a hammer. Try to untighten the nut with your hand. Utilize the path of least resistance first.” - Tim AllenThe prominent reasons for the wide adoption of Python is the ease of learning, usability and readability coupled with the powerful ecosystem of Python packages. This often makes Python an attractive language for researchers &amp; scholars to undertake computational projects and thesis. The ease of prototyping and tinkering also allows for higher number of iterations and customization in the project, leading to increase in research output. But, one of the pain points of Python is its speed when compared to languages like C++ or FORTRAN which are still widely used in research. Scholars, when hit by the performance bottleneck of pure python code, often come across some methods to increase their code performance like using PyMPI, Numpy or CPython. But, the learning curve is steep as things get less familiar. If learning Python is so easy, why should increasing the performance of Python code be so difficult?This talk will address this question and introduce Numba, an open source JIT compiler that translates Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. 3 real world computational problems and their Numba counter-parts will be presented to the audience to demonstrate the ease and effectiveness of using Numba. Thereby showcasing how it can be useful in lowering the barrier to achieve code performance for scientific computing using Python.

Graph databases have advantages over relational databases for certain use cases—including social networking, recommendation engines, and fraud detection—when you want to create relationships between data and quickly query these relationships. There are a number of challenges to building these types of applications using a relational database. It requires you to have multiple tables with multiple foreign keys. The SQL queries to navigate this data require nested queries and complex joins that quickly become unwieldy. And the queries don't perform well as your data size grows over time.In this talk, we will explore ways for a graph in a graph database (MovieLens dataset) that can be traversed along specific edge types, or across the entire graph. Apache TinkerPop™ is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP). Gremlin is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application’s property graph.

Defending AI models against adversarial attacks (using Python libraries Cleverhans and Foolbox),deya,"20 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/defending-ai-models-against-adversarial-attacks-using-python-libraries-cleverhans-and-foolbox~dwDwe/,Intermediate,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","01 Sep 2019, 22:15",NA,"Motivation of the talkSituation #1Imagine a self-driving car on the road they depend on computational perceptions of images of traffic signals. Now if that image is perturbed with very small imperceptible noise, it would lead the car to interpret the 'stop' signal as 'go' or maybe the 'go straight' as 'go left'. Imagine the kind of chaos and fatalities that would lead to! Situation #2Say you are building a deep learning classifier to predict if a tumor is benign or malignant. If an attacker perturbs very slightly a particular image that the classifier predicted as 'malignant', it would result in what is called adversarial fooling of neural networks  the classifier (even if it is a SOTA neural network) may predict the same one as 'benign'. That would lead to incorrect diagnosis and perhaps cost a life. (Same for a benign tumor caused to be predicted as malignant.)These are some of the reasons why the topic of privacy and security in AI is so important right now, and we must steer the great amount of buzz around AI to this topic right away.What the talk will coverIn this talk, I will discuss the hidden gems of Python libraries (like Cleverhans and Foolbox) that are very important to tackle such adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are nothing but addition of small amount of malicious input to a neural network to cause it to misclassify. I will show how these attacks a) compromise confidential and private data and b) fool neural networks to make wrong predictions.

Creating a crawler service to work efficiently at scale using Gevent and Flask,Rishi Raj Chopra (~rishi11),"20 Aug, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/creating-a-crawler-service-to-work-efficiently-at-scale-using-gevent-and-flask~ax9Eb/,Intermediate,Talks,Concurrency,"31 Aug 2017, 23:45",5,"With so much information available over the internet nowadays, crawling efficiently at scale has become inevitable. During crawling, most of the time in most of the cases is spent by the processor waiting for the response from the remote server to which the crawl request has been made. This happens more so in python due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).

Fortunately or unfortunately, in Machine Learning, these algorithms have been made available to us for use as wonderfully optimized, properly packaged and easy-to-use abstractions, think sci-kit-learn. Import a classifier and well be on your way. we essentially treat and use them as BLACKBOXES!Believe it or not, that is a MAGNIFICENT thing. This is a massive win for practicality, pragmatism and performance.But like just your Algorithms teacher told you when you asked him/her- why are we learning all these different sorting algorithms, when in practice you almost will never roll your own implementation? (This was a friend, totally not me)The teacher pulls down his thick bifocal glasses slightly, looks at you, while marveling at your fantastic haircut, in his firm but empathetic voice, he replies- Because the concepts you learn would be applicable to a wide range of problems in computer science and will help you understand other problems and concepts better.I had no reply, i mean my friend had no reply, and was humbled.  The Agenda, The What.In This talk, i will share with my audience, a crisp take on my journey of What i learned while hand-coding these fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch.  YOU will learn what happens under-the-hood when you use these classifier algorithms and how they work.  YOU Will get familiar with the fundamental concepts and ideas that under-pin almost all of these classifiers and more.  YOU will also be introduced to the math behind these algorithms, further helping in understanding and demystifying them.  The algorithms i plan to cover are-1) The Perceptron algorithm (where it all began)  2) ADALINE or adaptive linear neuron.  3) Logistic Regression.  4) IF time permits, Support Vector Machines.There will also be python code (not live coding), from where I implemented and trained these algorithms, to formally understand what is happening and what does what, with illustrations where necessary. Trust me, this will be neat ; )The OutcomeI would like my audience to leave with a clearer view and a greater appreciation of how machine learning happens in the real world, by focusing on what happens under-the-hood, when you pull that classifier out of your favorite machine learning library. The basic concepts that under-pin the fundamental classifiers and what machine learning algorithms try to do, and why it is OKAY to look into the so called blackboxes once in a while ; )OutlineAuthor Introduction and the premise of the talk.

We work with some of India’s most largest category defining companies to serve their users.. These include names such as Decathlon, MPL, and Milkbasket. We continue to double our user-conversations every 6 months. Our systems scale to a peak increase of ~5x messages everyday. Verloop now has the capability to support conversations on WhatsApp and web interfaces.This scaling is often accompanied a linear increase in number of agents and their frustration. We focus on eliminating the frustration. There are several ways we do this, including canned replies (on the ""/"" command) and new approach Smart Replies. Smart Replies suggests a response to each agent, on the basis of their personal and organisation's chat history. While this has been done at Google-scale, with their data and engineering scale, can we do this with the resources of a small 2-person ML team? The answer seem to be yes.

Natural Language Generation with Python,Jaidev Deshpande (~jaidev),"01 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/natural-language-generation-with-python~dJole/,Intermediate,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","24 Sep 2019, 17:52",NA,"A picture is worth a thousand words. Sometimes.Take a good look at this infographic (original post)Now try to remember your thoughts were as you were reading it. To an experienced audience, a few things would have stood out immediatelyIt's a scatterplot,Each point represents a GoT characterFor each character, it shows how many episodes they appeared in, and how much screen time they had averaged per episode.By this time, most viewers are already too bored - or are too distracted - to notice the real insight of the infographic, which is that Ned Stark dominates Game of Thrones by screen time, even though he was killed off in the ninth episode!The ProblemEven to the trained eye, even to those who do data visualization for a living, charts can be difficult to read. There is an entire industry around data interpretation, which is full of people whose sole job is to look at charts and come up with an explanation of what they see. The primary consumers of visualizations are such professionals. Unsurprisingly, the people who make decisions are almost never the consumers of visualizations - because visualizations are descriptive, and decision makers need information in a format that is prescriptive - something that recommends actions.Natural language generation (NLG) is a nascent, but very real technology that is filling this gap between raw data and consumable, actionable insights. Numerous studies have gone on to demonstrate that people are more likely to pay attention when information is narrated instead of simply displayed. At Gramener, our motto is ""Insights as stories"" - thus, natural language generation is an obvious technology for us to invest in. This talk is about how we built and open source natural language generation framework with little more than pandas and spaCy.The SolutionThis is a strictly shallow-learning problem. I really wish I could tell you that we used deep learning to generate text from raw data, but unfortunately there wasn't enough training data for deep learning to work. Thus, in order to solve it with relatively less data, we broke the problem down into smaller, shallower problems. The NLG pipeline is broken into three major modulesAutolysis (automatic exploratory data analysis) - most of the EDA that is usually carried out on structured data can be automated. Every insight that comes from a dataset is the result of one of a finite number of exploratory analyses. The NLG framework automates this by running the dataset against a set of models, and decides whether each resulting insight is significant enough to be narrated.Intent classification - This module deals with answering natural language questions about the data. Every question that can be posed to a data can be classified into one of a collection of intents, and each intent in turn dictates the text generation heuristics.Text generation - This is where most of the NLP comes into play. The text generation module accepts a structured object as input, which is expected to contain results of the previous stages, which is then rendered in a specified context. The context of text generation here can be an intent, or data.Outline of the TalkMotivation for NLG (2 mins)The NLG Problem - How do humans interpret data?

It has removed the limitations in the Map Reduce cluster computing programming  paradigm, which forces a particular one line flow of data structure on distributed programs. In Map Reduce program get input data from hard disk, map a function across the  input data, it reduces the result of  various map, and store reduction results on disk. Under the map reduce model, the primitives of data processing are known as mappers and other set is called reducers. Data processing application are decomposed into mappers and reducers is sometimes not trivial.

This saves memory and may avoid useless processing as well. And this exactly is what the Iterator pattern about.Python Generators are often considered a somewhat advanced topic, but they are actually very easy to understand once you start using them on a regular basis. This talk will also introduce you to a pragmatic use-case of generators in Python codebase.The presentation will lay the foundations of building concepts related to iteration and proceed to empower every developer to leverage their power. Here is the walkthrough all the topics I intend to coverBasic primer of different ways one can iterate over the built-in type objectsWhat are the differences between the terms iterable, iterator and generator?  Examples of iterable, iterator, generator function and tuple comprehensionsHow can one make user-defined objects iterable?

Sounds cool, right? Algorithmic Trading is the process of using computer programs, based on a predefined algorithm, for placing trades in order to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.(The above example is very basic. You can code very complex strategies!)Tell me the advantages of Algorithmic Trading over Conventional TradingHere are a few reasons why algorithmic trading can lead to high chances of success -Ability to take into account large number of factors for decision making, which can be practically impossible for a humanTrades can be timed correctly. Manually placing trade involves delay which may result in significant price change by the time trade is placedHuman error eliminated while placing tradesHuman emotions (greed/fear) taken out of execution, which otherwise may result in big lossesAnd lastly, you can use your precious time for something else! Just let your computer monitor the stock markets 24x7 and place trade orders for you.Ok. Now that you have got me interested, tell me quickly what this TALK will cover.For implementing Algorithmic Trading in Python, you need the following -Ability to query real time data (current stock price) Ability to query historical dataA strategy (ie the Algorithm), which gives out predictions whether to BUY, SELL or HOLD.Backtesting framework to test the strategyAbility to place BUY/SELL trade order at Indian Stock Exchanges (NSE/BSE) This TALK will demonstrate all the above mentioned points for the below strategy.Strategy (Algorithm) Crossover(EMA(3), EMA(15)) --&gt; Place Buy OrderCrossover(EMA(15), EMA(3)) --&gt; Place Sell OrderEvery Buy and Sell order is placed with 1% Stop Loss and 0.3% Target PriceThis strategy generated an average profit of ~6% per month (~72% annually) on real data of TATASTEEL (NSE) during backtesting for the period 16th June - 14th August, 2017.Click below to see the video of this backtesting strategy in action.",Basics of Python[Optional] Basics of Trading is a plus.

While reading this you are probably thinking about some awesome tunes that have stuck in your mind, or some composition in a raga that kept playing in your mind like a cassette that keeps playing the same song!One marvels at the composers who made such great music that you and me enjoy and wonder about their creativity. So what does it take to make music? Is it entirely god given? Or can we play god… at least a little bit ?Creating music artificiallyIn this talk we will attempt to encode some of the common structures in Hindustani Classical music and make a ragabot a code/bot that creates music. This is a fun exploration with some interesting experiments without a claim that we can really play god! May be just a little bit )We will present a framework in which a composition in a particular raga is a sequence of notes with a beat/rhythm. The sequence of notes has rules which allow / disallow some notes while some notes are dominant and occur more often than others. Some note sequences are characteristic of a raga. These structures/patterns defining the raga are encoded in a set of probabilities. Attached to each note is an array of probabilities which specifies the probability of transitioning from that note to other notes. In tech parlance this would be a Markov chain of sorts where the transition matrix is a stochastic matrix. We will present simple python based programming constructs which will generate a sequence of notes using the transition matrix. The resulting note sequence can then be played using MIDI files or on an instrument directly.Outline of the talkA brief about structures in Hindustani Classical music  5minThinking about raga notes as a Markov chain  5 minConstructing the probability matrix for a raga  5minCreating music using the matrix constructed  5minOpen questions a discussion on how ‘creative’ this python generator is not! 5min",Familiarity with basic pythonSome exposure to classical music will help but is not mandatoryLiteratureMarkov chainsRaga details,Ragabot-NotebookRogabot-repoPresentationTraining tuneTune generated using ragabot,"Vikrant PatilVikrant has over 13 years of experience in crafting software solutions.

In this talk, we explore how DeepFakes works purely from a Python coder's perspective to answer Why and How and What we can do about it.This talk is an ""light-on-math, high on code"" talk on how anyone can generate Deepfakes-like videos using off-the-shelf tools and frameworks such as PyTorch, ffmpeg, OpenCV among others. This technique borrows heavily from ideas originally described by the creator of the Deepfakes method on Reddit (and ideas borrowed from a paper by Nvidia).This talk is not a deep-dive into Deep Learning. It's a specific problem statement that we are looking to solve using the tools we have available to us. We'll focus on similar problems and similar domains since we want to spend more time talking about code and the problem itself than about nitty-gritties of DL or arguing about which frameworks/tools to use.OverviewIntroduction to DeepFakes (2-3 mins)Why Deep Learning? (3-4 mins) (Can skip this if we have some other speaker doing a basic intro to DL techniques)How traditional face-swapping CGI has worked (3 mins)        - Why Deep Learning is a great fit for this problem (1.5 min)Breaking down the problem into components (2 mins)Data Generation w/ code (2 mins)Intro to AutoEncoders w/ code (2-3 mins)Training + code (2-3 mins)Building a pipeline (4 mins) (If I don't have to concentrate on Introduction, I'll increase this part to dive a little deeper)Common problems + Problems I faced and getting past them (2 mins)Ethicality (1.5-2 mins)Current State of the Art + Where do we go from here (2 mins)Questions (~5 mins)Should you attend?You should attend ifYou are interested in understanding what all the hype about Deepfakes is aboutYou are interested in CGIYou want to know how they created Hulk in Marvel movies (and brought back Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars)The words ffmpeg, opencv, pytorch peek your interestWant to look at a specific use case of Python in the field of Deep Learning and clarify some ideas along the wayDo not attend ifYou expect to learn DL from a 30 minute talkYou are a DL practitioner expecting a discussion on research papers for 30 minsYou don't like looking at code in talks","Basic working knowledge of Python, and an open mind. Understanding of Deep Learning is helpful but not necessary. The talk isn't math heavy, or intended purely for DL folks, and I'll be abstracting concepts out to allow non-DL practitioners to follow along.In the talk, I'll also touch upon a bunch of tools like OpenCV and ffmpeg, but no knowledge of those is required.","[WIP] Slide Deck https//navinpai.github.io/pycon-deepfakes/Also, I presented a more general, less Python-focussed talk on the same topic at ExpertTalks Pune.

Probability for Hackers,nipunsadvilkar,"31 Jul, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/probability-for-hackers~dyJge/,Intermediate,Talks,Scientific Computing,"21 Sep 2017, 19:56",22,"Did you just say probability? Mathematics at a tech conference? This mathematical term tends to elicit very strong reactions (either positive or negative, depending on who you ask) since it has a reputation for being difficult to crack/to keep track it revolves around a seemingly endless jargon, abstract concepts, Greek letters as notations and more. Each concept holds its own subtle assumptions and everything is interlinked with each other. I know you have had enough of mathematics in the university but the way it is being taught is somewhat isolated from its practical application (less of a hands-on experience and more emphasis on theory) even though we encounter probability and statistics in our daily life. So, I am giving a go at ‘hacking the probability using code'.We live in a world of ‘Big Data’ today. No matter how large or complex a dataset is, it provides only incomplete information about the questions that interest us. This incomplete information leads to uncertainty. This is where ‘probability’ comes into picture. Probability is “The Science of Uncertainty”. It gives us ways to quantify uncertainty and use it as one of the primary methods for designing new algorithms to model complex data. We use a computer to make predictions about new and/or uncertain events. These algorithms are nothing but Machine Learning techniques that provide automated methods of data analysis. In fact, all of us have already been users of these techniques. To name a few – Automated Spam Detection and filtering in e-mails, product/video recommendation (e.g., ""customers who bought/watched X are also likely to buy/watch Y""). All of these are applications of probability in computer science. Most of machine learning techniques are rooted in probabilistic methods and we use it in many forms such as to know what is the best prediction about the future given/considering some past data? What is the best model to explain some data? What measurement should I perform next? etc. This is why it is important to learn probability.In this talk, I will discuss how you can use your coding skills to ""hack probability"" – to replace some of the theory and jargon with intuitive computational approaches. My intention here is not to explain any concept precisely, but to merely lay down enough of them on the table to emphasize the role of probability in the fast growing areas such as Artificial Intelligence (superset of Machine Learning and Deep Learning), and Data Science.“Not once, but twice AI was revolutionized by people who understood Probability Theory”[HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]- Stanford University | CS 109 Probability for Computer ScientistsTalk StructureIntroduction[HTML_REMOVED]      a.

In addition to that, it will be more applicable if your website has the continuous addition of content, like a blog or an online e-book website.Outline of the talkMetrics for a high-performance websiteDifferent metrics like text minification and image compression will be discussed on the basis of which one can optimize the websiteExisting static blog generatorsThere are many static website generators like Jekyll which are very powerful and the most of which use markdown for generating web pagesJinja for writing web pagesJinja helps us generating custom web pages based on some template and can also help us write components to which we can pass data from our Python codeUsing Frozen-Flask for rendering HTML pagesDetails about Frozen-Flask and what exactly it does. This section will also discuss how Frozen-Flask can be used for building high-performance website.Optimizing images by automatically compressing themUsing different Python image processing libraries that have an image compressing ability, in order to compress the images that will be served.Minifying the files and combining them into a single fileAgain, using different Python minification libraries for minification of HTML, JS, CSS in order to perform minification so that a minified file can be served.Detailed DescriptionMost of the things mentioned above like optimizations will be done by using different Python tools and libraries. A combination of these tools and libraries together form a custom toolchain for your website generator. This has a very good impact on how you are making the website while giving you a 'Do It Yourself' feel. While in comparison with more popular static website generators, this talk will discuss more things about using Frozen-Flask in place of the traditional website generator. Unlike using Jinja and Flask to write server side web pages, Frozen-Flask allows us to generate a static website from the endpoint routes that are given to Flask. The resultant build that you get can be hosted anywhere for a very cheap cost even on something like Amazon S3. Most of the existing static website generators use Markdown for the website generation. The talk will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Markdown vs using Jinja for your website generator. Also, this will discuss different features of Jinja templating engine and how those features give an additional leverage while writing your own website. Last but not the least, this talk will cover different libraries which when used in combination with each other will form an automated toolchain which will do all the optimization and the necessary processing for the generation of the web pages. The processing can be something very basic as in passing data to the Jinja templates in order to generate the necessary HTML files. The optimization will consist of things like using Python image processing libraries and minification libraries to compress the images and to minify the parseable text files that will be served as your web page.","This talk requires a decent knowledge of Python, Flask and Jinja, and also good knowledge of HTML and making simple web pages.

Performance optimization with Python-Elasticsearch,Anisha Swain (~anisha24),"01 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/performance-optimization-with-python-elasticsearch~eXJlb/,Beginner,Talks,Developer tools and automation,"01 Sep 2019, 22:37",NA,"ObjectiveBy the end of this talk we would be able to have an idea about how to handle extremely large documents in Elasticsearch queries and implement custom filters to analyze query strings.OverviewWhenever we think of implementing search for our application data, Elasticsearch bubbles up as one of the top choices for search. Elasticsearch is a popular, open source search stack used by web, mobile and cloud applications for search applications. But when it comes to large numbers of documents, Elasticsearch requires proper analysis of the query items. It requires custom filters to reduce the post processing of fetched data, as well as enhance the performance of the API at the same time. ProblemSometimes when we query data from Elasticsearch, more amount of data is fetched from the required amount which again needs post processing resulting in eating up more memory and degrading performance. The deep pagination of large amount of data is the costliest part of the process. Hence this talk is about returning all documents quite cheaply and increase the performance as well as trying to eliminate the post processing.ApproachStarting from using simple aggregations, this talk will do a deep dive of the design of analyzers for use different combinations of Tokenizers and TokenFilters. This will save us from fetching large data by being certain about the query and enhance the search capability. Analyzers are the special algorithms that determine how a string field in a document is transformed into terms in searching.It will also touch the aspect of using scan and scroll API for retrieval of humongous amount of data in batches without paying penalty for deep pagination. A scrolled search allows us to do an initial search and to keep pulling batches(amount depends on the customization) of results from Elasticsearch until there are no more results left and the scanning part disables sorting of results, making the process a lot cheaper.Outline of the talk (~35 mins)Intro to Elasticsearch (2-3 min)Documents and Indices.Search and Analyze.Aggregations (3 min)All about Analyzer (10 min)The Components of an AnalyzerNormalizers (3 min)Tokenizers (3 min)Token Filters (3 min)The Components of an Analyzer (5 min)Scan and Scroll API (with Demo)(5 min)Conclusion and Q/A(2 min)Key takeawaysSome of the key takeaways from this talk should be -- Understanding simple data aggregation - Dealing with a large amount of documents query with pagination/scrolling- Choosing the right analyzer for an Elasticsearch query can be as much an art as science.Who is this talk for?Python/JavaScript developers who deal with performance issues on a daily basis.

Using Vulture to improve used-to-unused code ratio of your Python Programs,Rahul Jha (~RJ722),"04 Jul, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/using-vulture-to-improve-used-to-unused-code-ratio-of-your-python-programs~aKnze/,Beginner,Talks,Developer tools and automation,"01 Sep 2019, 22:38",NA,"Maintaining a high level of code quality is important for any serious project. One aspect of this is ensuring that all code is actually used. There are many reasons for dead code ending up in a project. The most common is refactoring, but another is misspellings, which are only detected at runtime for dynamic languages. Finding and removing dead code allows to keep the code base clean and reduces bugs. This talk is focused on how we can use Vulture to find dead code. It helps you find unused code in Python programs and it is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested code. Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, Vulture can be a very helpful tool for higher code quality.One part of this talk is to discuss how to automate testing for dead code with Vulture. There are quite a few options availableAdding vulture to your continuous integration testing.A script using the Vulture API for custom tests.VultureBear Integration with coala - a static code analysis tool.Integration with automatic analysis tools like Gitmate, etc. for automatic code-reviews with native support for GitHub and GitLab.Please also note that a talk was given on the same subject during PyCon India 2017 by the same speaker, but since then, several features have been added to Vulture and it's API.","The only prerequisite is willingness to do the hard work required for making your codebase maintainable.If someone in audience wants to follow along, please install Python &gt; 2.6 and pip on your computer.","vultureThe slides accompanying the talk, along with all the examples may be found at RJ722/reducing-dead-codeRJ722/example-vulture displays an example on how we can integrate vulture with CI tests.There is also this blog post - Why use coverage to find which Python code is run, but as you can guess from the title, it isn't dedicated entirely to vulture, but still serves as a nice introduction for the workflow involved with using Vulture.","Rahul is a final year Electronics Engineering student at Aligarh Muslim University.

Exploring Augmented Reality with Python,Srikar Mutnuri (~srikar),"22 Apr, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/exploring-augmented-reality-with-python~e0rKb/,Beginner,Talks,Game Design and 3D Modelling,"01 Sep 2019, 22:48",NA,"This is the main focus of the talk Build a simple AR app, using Python.While it is possible to develop instant Augmented Reality (AR) applications using some out-of-the-box libraries, the use of Python for AR, while still a bit nascent, is a portal to a plethora of opportunities - literally. At its core, AR can be said to be basically a Computer Vision problem with some twists, and thats something Python has already well taken care of, with numerous libraries (OpenCV, I'm looking at you), which should make it a very obvious choice for developing AR apps - but that is not the current situation.True, the existing libraries (like ARCore, written in other languages like C++ or C#) have everything taken care of on our behalf, and allow us to simply write down a few lines of code to pop a virtual character here and a 3D object there in to the real world. But with the current SOTA in Python, we might have to sweat out and dig deeper into the nitty gritty of projecting a virtual object into the real world - feature extraction, homography and projection (among others), and handle every aspect of the process ourselves. Given the extensive libraries and tools at our disposal when taking the Pythonic approach, all this could become quite simple. The central goal is to take the audience through this process, and equip them with means to build their own primitive AR app with Python. In addition, I would also be exploring, in theory, some of the major problems which hinder good AR experiences, like occlusion and performance optimisation, and how various Machine Learning models can help us solve them.OutlineVision - Human and Machine (3 min)AR and Computer Vision (2 min)AR - under the hood (7 min)Some issues, and potential solutions (5 min)Demo (~5 min)Conclusion","Basic knowledge about PythonGeneral understanding of Computer Vision and some linear algebra (recommended, but not necessary)","Link to slides (WIP)For a general overview of the topic, the below two articles can be a great start.

Hunger and poverty are byproducts of multiple factors and fighting them require multi-fold effort from all stakeholders. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning has transformed the way we live, work and interact. However economics of business has limited its application to few segments of the society. A much conscious effort is needed to bring the power of AI to the benefits of the ones who actually need it the most – people below the poverty line. Here we present our thoughts on how deep learning and big data analytics can be combined to enable effective implementation of anti-poverty programs. The advancements in deep learning , micro diagnostics combined with effective technology policy is the right recipe for a progressive growth of a nation. Deep learning can help identify poverty zones across the globe based on night time images where the level of light correlates to higher economic growth. Once the areas of lower economic growth are identified, geographic and demographic data can be combined to establish micro level diagnostics of these underdeveloped area. The insights from the data can help plan an effective intervention program. Machine Learning can be further used to identify potential donors, investors and contributors across the globe based on their skill-set, interest, history, ethnicity, purchasing power and their native connect to the location of the proposed program. Adequate resource allocation and efficient design of the program will also not guarantee success of a program unless the project execution is supervised at grass-root level.

I've been making tiny things with it, but I quickly realized I wanted to make something bigger. I own upwards of 1500 books. It becomes hard to find a book in my bookshelves sometimes. So I decided to buy a few NeoPixel strips, stick them to my bookshelves, and have the lights blink to indicate the position of a book. Granted, I needed to do a lot of work to get this working. I needed a database for the books, I needed to be able to add, remove and move books around, and I wanted to be able to do this without opening a terminal and sending curl commands.In short, I wanted to build a voice interface for my bookshelf so that I could do something like ask it where my copy of the Lord of the Rings is and it would light up in response.In this session I'll describe how you can leverage a few Raspberry Pis, write code in Micropython and use NeoPixels to find items stored in racks or shelves.

Python based simulation and treatment planning in Craniofacial Surgery: Advances and Challenges.,drakileshr,"30 Jun, 2019",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/python-based-simulation-and-treatment-planning-in-craniofacial-surgery-advances-and-challenges~dJBDd/,Intermediate,Talks,"Data Science, Machine Learning and AI","04 Sep 2019, 08:06",NA,"Python is like the legendary ""James Bond"". Not just because it is versatile but also because it can easily make ""bonds"" with other programming languages using wrappers. From a computer hobbyist to a hardcore enthusiastic user with interest in anything technology can offer for healthcare and research, I have come a long way. I am a learner still and am proud of it.I have been a soldier of fortune in healthcare information technology with no specific loyalty to anything in the field of healthcare information technology except to the healthcare part. So for all of my professional life, I aspire to be just this enthusiast and a critical analyst of anything technical as applied to healthcare.In this talk, I wish to share my journey with Python and R in my primary field of work, healthcare. This will include mostly research work/exploratory work in the fields of Image analysis, 3D modelling &amp; Data analytics as applicable to healthcare, especially evidence synthesis using python/R. And then I wish to ponder on how and if python can be of everyday use to a healthcare professional and end-user.OutlineIn addition to highlighting the 3D treatment planning and opportunities for integrating python for modules for virtual surgery, I was hoping to delve into simulation which may be used for training, research and performing/testing new procedures in a virtual environment.While this may not translate into actual experience in-toto, with the clinicians and developers understanding the limitations and benefits of this approach, a lot of surgical skill sets can be improved using these virtual simulations. My core concentration will be for implementation  of these ideas in Craniofacial surgery.Can Python live upto this challenge of simulating surgeries ? Can it be a reliable for a clinician ? My objective is to present a framework and concept where these ideas will not just remain as thesis on the bookshelves of universities but they will remain as friends for doctors and researchers in their practice and perhaps in Operation Theater in real time!In Conclusion, I will list some of the exciting possibilities in other fields of surgery as well and I will also highlight the barriers in the process. There is a need for integrated collaborative co-design in these such projects.",An Open mind and just a little bit of interest into healthcare technology.,My previous academic interactions in ResearchGate platformResearchGate Profile,"I am an oral and maxillofacial surgeon (a specialised field of dentistry), with an ardent interest into the good, bad and ugly aspects of technology as applied to healthcare field. Clinical, research, practice, publication writing, digitisation, patient safety, health informatics.... you name it and I would have either dabbled in it or would be willing to jump in and explore, if I haven't heard of it yet.My exploration of python started out as simple interest into data-analytics and using Text-as-data for data extraction and topic modelling largely for my own learning purposes. From there, I got drawn back into the 3D modelling using python based tools available as open source (having given up on them years ago, never knowing they were python based, due to the resource intensiveness and steep learning curve which I regret!!). Now I am exploring into usage of technology for medical image analysis, 3-D modelling for clinical/research and data-analytics as applicable to healthcare with a touch of automation, especially in areas of head and neck surgery.I miss Chennai a little, but a ships are meant to be anchored in the harbour. Right? I am out again, exploring in the far north, working in the Department of Dentistry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Gorakhpur. Through this conference, I wish to gain new insights that I can share with medical community when I go back. And I wish to share with the IT community in general and with Pythonistas in particular about some of the practical aspects of python as applicable to medical field (beyond research) in this conference.",My talk with Chennaipy meet up group on Python in Medicine

In this talk we will particularly demonstrate why edge computing is crucial to IoT in deriving the essential ROI of IoT applications extending it to a case study. The outline of the talk will be as follows - What is edge computing and its architecture and the beneficial features it delivers (2 mins)SpeedScalabilityGuaranteed reduced latency and guaranteed effective bandwidthPrivacy and SecurityLast but not least, reduced costWhy is edge analytics crucial to IoT discussing specific use cases of various industry verticals (5 mins) Fog computing, how is it different from edge computing and how is it enabling edge computing. Extending beyond, how is edge computing complimenting the existing cloud computing infrastructures  (3 mins)Various machine learning and deep learning architectures available for resource constraint analytics (5 mins)Demo (10 mins) Consider a case study of healthcare industry, a patient suffering from brain injury is being monitored in an ICU 24*7 with the help of connected healthcare equipment's where the readings of his body vitals are collected every second. Each second is crucial to the patient's life. These vitals collected are sent to the cloud to analyse for occurrences of seizures or any other extreme events related to internal damage within the brain. This to and fro travel of data and information are dependent on the network bandwidth, which is time consuming as well as vulnerable to cyber attacks. Medical data are always sensitive data. At a situation where the network bandwidth or security is compromised, we would need an infrastructure which is capable of  delivering immediate insight closer to the sensors collecting the data so that the required action can be performed immediately as well as privacy and security of the data is maintained. Keeping this scenario in mind, a seizure prediction solution will be demonstrated on Raspberry Pi (resource constraint edge device) using machine learning and AWS IoT capabilities to derive secured, minimum latency insights offline without depending on network bandwidth and the time lag between to and fro travel of data and information between sensors and cloud.

Scalable Big Data solutions using Lambda Architecture,Navya Agarwal (~navya),"18 Jul, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/scalable-big-data-solutions-using-lambda-architecture~elM7a/,Intermediate,Talks,Data Analysis and Visualization,"22 Aug 2017, 22:56",6,"In this digital age, we are generating data at an unprecedented rate. But generating data is not the same as curating knowledge. To extract useful insights from the data and to tame the three Vs of data (Volume, Velocity and Variety), we need to rethink our tools and design principles.There are two orthogonal approaches to solve this problem. One approach is where we use a new set of tools NoSQL Databases - Mongo, Cassandra, HBaseHighly Scalable Message Queues - KafkaDistributed filesystems - HDFSMapReduce Paradigm - Hadoop, SparkThe other and more fundamental line of thought is to innovate around the underlying architecture itself.  In this series of innovations and improvement, we have an alternate paradigm for Big Data computation - the Lambda ArchitectureLambda architecture - a generic, scalable and fault-tolerant data processing architecture and goes beyond any specific set of tools or libraries. As a concrete example, PySpark provides abstractions which makes it very easy to write big data applications. Alternatively, one may build their own big data application using components like Airflow, PyAkka etc. The idea of this talk is to introduce the architecture itself and make it easy for people to understand and relate to it.In this talk we would cover the following aspects Introduction and motivationDesign philosophy behind Lambda ArchitectureComponentsPros and ConsApplicationsAlternatives to Lambda ArchitectureWe would be doing this talk as a dialogue between the two speakers to encourage thought-processing and brainstorming in the audience.

SymEngine: Leveraging The Power Of A Computer Algebra System (CAS) To Another,Shikhar Jaiswal (~ShikharJ),"12 Jul, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/symengine-leveraging-the-power-of-a-computer-algebra-system-cas-to-another~e1V0a/,Beginner,Talks,Scientific Computing,"05 Sep 2017, 00:10",13,"AbstractSymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured Computer Algebra System (CAS) which is comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.The primary goal of SymEngine as a CAS is to utilize the performance improvement of C++ over Python, in speeding up the computations performed by the SymPy core. Using SymEngine's  Python wrapper, SymEngine.py, we aim to completely replace the SymPy core with that of SymEngine, keeping the changes minimal and the ensuring code integrity, while greatly speeding up the computations and expression handling.We will present a short talk on the current status of development, how things are implemented internally, how we chose the language of development, benchmarks with other well known Computer Algebra Systems (such as Mathematica, SymPy, GiNaC and Maple), and a heavier explanation on examples of usage of the C++ library in Python with SymPy CAS, Sage CAS and PyDy multi-body dynamics toolkit. Wrappers to other languages (C, Ruby, Julia and Haskell) are also available.The DetailsMotivationSymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While it turns out to be very useful for many applications, one of the long-term problems with SymPy has been that the speed might be insufficient while handling very large expressions. Another problem is that due to being written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use from other languages like Julia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python to Julia bridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additional overheads.MethodsFor these reasons, we implemented SymEngine, an open-source C++ symbolic manipulation library, with the goal of being the fastest library for symbolic manipulation, and allowing the use to other languages like Python (the most mature wrapper), Ruby, Julia, Haskell and C.ResultsWe will show benchmarks comparing other popular Computer Algebra Systems (both open-source and commercial). We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the code cannot have an undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease of development as one is used to from Python), while being blazingly fast in Release mode.The talk will focus heavily on SymEngine's use in SymPy, Sage and PyDy software (all three being Python based software). Detailed examples will be presented on various mathematical functionalities implemented, through SymPy and SymEngine created objects, as well as the details of our use of Cython language (not to be confused with CPython) in wrapping C++ data structures and creating Python and Cython classes as per the requirements. Some amount of time will also be devoted to the issues faced, and the solutions implemented while wrapping off the library in Python. We will also present a road-map portraying the present as well as previous strategies on porting SymPy on top of SymEngine.The library already has 46 contributors, 151 forks and 254 stars on GitHub, as of July 12, 2017.ConclusionSymEngine should fix the slowness of SymPy, while providing a familiar interface, and at the same allowing many languages to use it, thus creating a common platform/tool that many projects (like SymPy, Sage, PyDy ...) can use as their main symbolic engine and all contribute back to it.","Basic knowledge of Python and C++ languages.Basic mathematics, just enough to appreciate the manipulations done preferred.","ResourcesContents of presentation prepared by the SymEngine team, along with the respective IPython/Jupyter notebooks can be found in this Github repository.The presentation slides can be directly viewed here.Few Extra LinksSymEngine (C wrappers included)SymEngine Python Wrappers (with SymPy and Sage integration)SymEngine Ruby WrappersSymEngine Julia WrappersSymEngine Haskell WrappersPyDySageSymPy","Shikhar is currently a second year undergraduate at IIT Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.He is a contributor to SymPy, SymEngine as well as SymEngine.py.He is currently pursuing his Google Summer of Code 2017 project for SymEngine titled Improving SymEngine's Python Wrappers and SymPy-SymEngine Integration under SymPy, with Sumith as one of the mentors.Sumith is currently a fourth year Computer Science undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.He is a contributor to SymPy as well as SymEngine, currently a mentor of GSoC 2017 for two projects under the SymPy organisation.

Out-of-core Analytics Using Python,Gopi Suvanam (~gopi32),"10 Jul, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/out-of-core-analytics-using-python~bWW4b/,Advanced,Talks,Data Analysis and Visualization,"16 Aug 2017, 10:44",4,Most analytics packages in Python store data and perform analysis/modeling in the memory. This puts a limitation on the use of packages for data that does not fit in memory. As a result several data scientists are forced to use non-Python packages (like Spark etc.) for performing analysis on larger data sets. We propose an architecture using column-stores on the disc and of out-of-core processing in Python to circumvent this problem. The talk will focus on how one can handle descriptive analytics and machine learning using a basic set of primitive calculations. The talk will also highlight implementation using MonetDB as the column-store.

You wish to have a client which collects information from these devices, issues commands to them and you may also want to establish communication between these devices. A toolkit like Tango may well be what you're looking for. You would write Tango device servers for each of these devices. These device server classes would expose commands, attributes and properties. When you write the code for a Tango device server command, you would call the device specific command, in the device supported language to be executed from the device specific OS, whereas the Tango device server command could be called from anywhere and using any language (like a wrapper around the underlying device command) You could also use Tango to write client side application code in a language and on a platform of your choice.Tango Controls is a free and open source device oriented, distributed control system toolkit for controlling any kind of hardware or software. If you're looking at building solutions for Distributed Control Systems (DCS), SCADA systems or if you're into embedded platforms, IoT applications or System Integration Platforms, Tango might be the solution. At a high level, it is a toolkit for building and integrating systems and for connecting things together.Some of its key features are - it provides a unified interface to all equipment (hardware), is operating system independent, provides Python, C++ and Java support for all of its components, is flexible, highly scalable, supports multiple communication protocols, has a rich API, has a thriving community which contributes hundreds of device classes (most of your use cases might already have code written for it), support for building custom UIs using toolkits like Taurus, etc.This session will delve into the following aspectsA brief look into the Tango toolkit (with a focus on why you might be interested in it)A high level overview of the design principles and what a 'device oriented' model means.Writing device servers and client applications in Python with PyTango (this is the primary focus of the talk)Using tools like Jive (to manage device servers), Taurus (for creating UIs), Pogo (code generator for creating device classes) to illustrate the ease of using the Tango toolkit.A PyTango use case example - the Health Monitor Server of the Italian Mars Society.By the end of this talk, you would be able to appreciate the utility of the Tango toolkit and be able to decide if it fits your use case. More importantly, you will be in a position to write Python device server classes and client side code using PyTango. You will also have a brief idea of the design principles and how things work in practice.Working with the Tango toolkit (PyTango to be specific) is a part of my GSoC project.","A basic working understanding of Python (Data Types and Structures, Classes, Methods, Loops) and a familiarity with Object Oriented Programming.You will not be needing to know any of the above mentioned architectures like SCADA, DCS, etc. Tango is very generic and flexible.",Link to slide deck - Slides have been uploaded - they will be updated based on the comments if need be.http//www.tango-controls.org/Tango - WikipediaTango Control System - SourceForgeTango Device Servers - SourceForgePyTango docsItalian Mars Society - GitHubLink to my GSoC blog and my project partner's,"I am a passionate developer, currently working as a Google Summer of Code Student at the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

Transfer learning provides a similar capability to artificial neural networks. The Workshop will introduce the concept of 'Transfer Learning' described by Andrew Ng, the leading expert in Machine Learning as the ""next driver of ML commercial success."" Transfer Learning is important because training deep neural networks from scratch have two key requirements. First, we need a large labeled dataset; the second one requires computationally efficient hardware (GPUs). While such immensely large data exists for some tasks and domains, in most cases the data are usually proprietary or expensive. Transfer Learning, the technique to use models pre-trained on one domain for another problem domain, provides the ability to use DNNs even when the dataset is small. Moreover, Transfer learning requires less computation and thus can be done in respectable time using CPUs as well.The workshop will cover following topicsIntroduction to Transfer Learning Application of Transfer LearningTransfer Learning Scenarios Applying Transfer using Keras and TensorflowAnd finally, we will have hands on session demonstrating how to use Xception and Inception networks for Dog breed Recognition.","Anaconda installed (Python =3.5)Tensorflow 1.xNumpyMatplotlibPandasSeabornFor the sake of convenience and due to limited time, Speaker, will also provide environment 'yml' files (Windows10, Ubuntu14.04/16.04, Mac OS X)","To make best use of the workshop it would be appreciated if participants are well versed with Anaconda, Python and understand Convolution Neural Networks.

Effectively Debugging Deep Neural Networks,Jaidev Deshpande (~jaidev),"12 Jul, 2017",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2017/proposals/effectively-debugging-deep-neural-networks~e3Y4b/,Advanced,Workshops,Scientific Computing,"17 Oct 2017, 08:14",13,"Deep learning is expensive. Not only is there a steep (human) learning curve, there is also an immense cost in designing and training a deep neural network. In typical R&amp;D settings, it is very common for a deep network to take days to train. To make things even more tough, there are no guarantees of convergence. It is not uncommon to find that a network has learnt nothing even after hours or even days of training. And it is likely that we as practitioners, too, might not learn much from the experience. The worst possible way to deal with an untrainable network is to leave it alone (apart from a few minor tweaks like changing the learning rate or picking a different training subset of the data) and let it run for another few hours or days.Python is known best to be a language that allows you to do rapid prototyping. But even this feature is at its least impressive when it comes to deep learning (understandably so, since Python is just the top layer in most deep learning frameworks). Nevertheless, there are many techniques one can employ to help improve feedback from the network, and even to fail fast, thereby saving precious time.While no algorithm or technique can guarantee whether a network will learn anything to a specified degree, there are many practices we can use to be relatively more confident about the performance of the network, as against being totally in the dark. One should be able to say with some confidence, things of this sort""The loss should have dropped below X by now.""""It should have learnt to classify at least the second category from the rest.""""It should clearly not be taking so long to converge.""This is an advanced workshop intended to make users comfortable with debugging deep networks.","Basics of neural networks The audiences should know what the different hyperparameters of neural networks are, especially learning rate, gradient optimizers, regularization methods etc. We will be learning how to pick the correct combination of these for a specific problem.Entry-level experience with kerasBasics of either one of tensorflow of theanoA laptop with a at least a quad-core processor (you should see four cores when you open the Task Manager or htop) and and at least 4GB memory.",In progress.,"I am a data scientist based in New Delhi.

It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.This tutorial is intended to cover the basics as well as touch on more advanced topics and new features that are added recent years. We will start by showing how to install and configure this Python module. Then we will proceed to the basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy. We will also discuss the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the remaining part of this tutorial we will show how to solve mathematical problems with SymPy.This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).SymEngine is a standalone fast C++ symbolic manipulation library. Optional thin wrappers allow usage of the library from other languages (Python, Ruby, Julia, Haskell).The workshop will also include a hands-on introduction to SymEngine in Python for the advantages of speed while using SymPy. This section would focus heavily on SymEngine's Python wrapper called SymEngine.py, and the various methodologies employed by it, the use of Cython, an account of the modules currently supporting the use of SymEngine, the subsequent impact on performance and the major projects using SymEngine. In addition to the above, there will also be a light introduction towards installation and usage of SymEngine library in Ruby, Haskell and Julia, through their respective wrappers.","We expect attendees of this tutorial to have basic knowledge of Python, C++, Ruby, Julia and mathematics. However, many more advanced topics for SymPy will be explained during presentation and basic examples for SymEngine wrappers. No prior knowledge of SymPy or other Python libraries is required, although it is suggested that attendees be familiar with the IPython notebook.We recommend that the attendees install the Anaconda Python distribution which includes SymPy, NumPy, and IPython.

This workshop will cover the following aspects. Creating open hotspot using Python and HostAPDConfiguring HostAPD on Raspberry PiDHCP Configuration and Management Creating Basic App using tornadoSystem Process and RunnablesHands on Raspberry PiWhat is a Captive Portal ?A captive portal is a Web page that the user of a public-access network is obliged to view and interact with before access is granted. Captive portals are typically used by business centers, airports, hotel lobbies, coffee shops, and other venues that offer free Wi-Fi hot spots for Internet users.Advantages of Captive PortalCaptive Portals allow for the separation and segregation of guest traffic. This has tons of security benefits including keeping un-trusted users away from confidential resources through network access control policies.These portals provide data accounting based on time, date and user. This is a standard feature in guest access. Future access to logs will facilitate administrators to find out certain users and their actions in a corporate network.A landing page will serve as a means of identifying your brand as well as a way to boost your marketing message. Companies can take advantage of the virtually limitless potential that captive portals possess to raise brand awareness by utilizing its less obvious abilities.Providing free internet services doesn’t mean that you're always providing secure internet service. An accepted usage policy (AUP) on your active portal ensures that users understand just that.Some users of a free public wireless network may repeatedly connect, using the network on an almost continuous basis for bandwidth hogging activities like downloading music, videos, or other large files. For them you can provide ample bandwidth throttling. TornadoTornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, Web-Sockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.Insight into IPTABLESiptables is a user-space application program that allows a system administrator to configure the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores.Besides the obvious situations where you might imagine this would be useful, such as blocking long lists of ""bad"" hosts without worry of killing system resources or causing network congestion, IP sets also open up new ways of approaching certain aspects of firewall design and simplify many configuration scenarios.IPSET  IP sets are a framework inside the Linux kernel, which can be administered by the ipset utility. Depending on the type, an IP set may store IP addresses, networks, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, MAC addresses, interface names or combinations of them in a way, which ensures lightning speed when matching an entry against a set.",Pre-requisite for this talkBasic Idea of IPSET and IPTABLES in LinuxBasic Idea of Tornado [If not! then don't worry you can check out sample from here.

If you keep on adding monitoring, you end up having a huge pile of alerts and failures every day.To ensure availability of product as you scale, either you automate or you die. This is where Auto- Remediation comes into picture.Auto-Remediation, or Self-Healing, is a workflow which triggers and responds to alerts or events by executing actions that can prevent or fix the problem.The simplest example of auto-remediation is restarting a service (let’s say apache) when it’s down. Imagine an automated action that is triggered by a monitoring system to restart the service and prevent the application outage. In addition, it creates a task and sends a notification so that the engineer can find the root cause during business hours, and there is no need to do it in the middle of the night.

We will be able to tell apart false IPs on HTTPS, but we are totally helpless while getting the correct IPs or safeguarding the services that do not implement SSL.The solution lies by querying the DNS inside our own network, where we are sure of not being MitM'd.To approach the above, we will be running a DNS Server on our system, and sourcing the replies not by the conventional way of upstreaming it via port 53, but by fetching the DNS information via HTTPS using Google's DNS APIs.In the attached repo, I have implemented a simple DNS Server written using Twisted. It is based on a Twisted DNSServerFactory, using a custom DNS resolver, which is fetching the DNS by querying dns.google.com over HTTPS, fetching the JSON response, and further translating it to a DNS response to be used locally.","Purpose of DNSFamiliarity with digHow basic Man in the Middle attack works, and how cryptographic systems beat itWhat is DNSSEC",github.com/arn7av/gDNSPresentationpip,"Arnav is currently working as a Developer at hedgehog lab, Hyderabad.

One aspect of this is ensuring that all code is actually used. There are many reasons for dead code ending up in a project. The most common is refactoring, but another is misspellings, which are only detected at runtime for dynamic languages. Finding and removing dead code allows to keep the code base clean and reduces bugs. This talk is focussed on how we can use Vulture to find dead code. It helps you find unused code in Python programs and it is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested code. Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused.

This makes sifting through the various combinations of algorithm-parameters a work of a seasoned professional.Adding to the complexity in finding the best machine learning model for your particular use-case, is the prerequisite of knowing any of the myriad data-science centric programming languages like Python, R or Julia and a knowledge of extracting the best features from the available dataset. Pre-processing the data to handle missing values, categorical features and columns with low information content becomes as important as the algorithm you have chosen.About PyProfound - PyProfound is an open-source desktop application built using electron.js and Python, that takes a dataset of your choice and returns a machine learning model which scores the best on cross-validation among all combinations possible on Scikit-Learn. The feature extraction module automatically generates natural language features like part-of-speech tags, named entities in the case of textual data. In our algorithm to search for the best model, we also plan to compare the parsing output from the most popular open-source text parsers available such as Stanford’s CoreNLP, Python NLTK, SpaCy and Google’s Parsey McParseface. There would soon be a bot interface to the application as well, which would make the application much easier to use — it would seem like you are being guided by a machine learning expert on the other end.During the talk, we will explain how the application runs through a battery of pre-processing steps and performs a grid-search like operation on the feature vectors to find the one true classifier.","No programming knowledge required — it is a GUI after all.

Ensemble Models,Prajwal Kailas (~prajwal),"29 Jun, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/ensemble-models~dBnnd/,Beginner,Talks,Data Visualization and Analytics,"25 Jul 2016, 14:36",1,"It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-of-art model ?Ensemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the power of computing. Ensemble methods aren’t new. They form the basis for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from various base models to create a stronger/better model output.This talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.Using third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies 1) Weighted Average 2) Stacking 3)BlendingReal-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared against single best-performing models.We at Unnati Data Labs have built a package for performing the ensembling of machine learning models.The motivation was to incorporate the various techniques described into a single python package. The current version of the package has the power to perform weighted averaging, and build stacking and blending models for binary classification. The other ensembling techniques will be incorporated in the future. The package enables data encoding, the desired data on which the user wishes to classify the data, can be encoded in many different ways like label encoding (categorical encoding), one hot encoding, sum encoding, polynomial encoding, backward difference encoding, helmert encoding, and hashing encoding. The encoded data will then be used to train the base models. The package provides the user with the ability to build a number of base models such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi Layer Perceptron, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. The user can build any or all the base models with default parameter values, change the parameter values or provide a list of parameter values to perform hyper parameter optimistaion (Using Hyperopt and Grid Search) and identify the optimum parameter values. Once the desired parameter values have been obtained the respective base models will be trained. Upon training the models, the trained models are used to obtain predictions on the cross validation data, these predictions obtained from the base models will be used to construct a data frame, which will be used to train the stacking and blending models, and perform weighted averaging.Once the base models have been trained the user can select which ensembling technique to use. The dataframe of predictions will be used to perform weighted averaging, the same dataframe will be used to train the stacking model, for training the blending model the dataframe of predictions will be appended with the cross validation data. To train the ensemble models the algorithm or classifier which will be used can be any of the algorithms/classifiers provided for the training of the base models. For testing the stacking and blending models we can hold out a test set which can be used to examine how well these ensemble models perform, wether they overfit, underfit, provide better performance than the base models.Why this package stands out? First of, the package enables data encoding which provides more flexibility and information which can imporve the performance of the models. The package utilizes hyperopt and gridsearch to perform hyper parameter optimization, so at the time of training the models, we have the optimum parameter values which yields improved performance. Since ensembling involves building and training multiple models with the option of performing hyper parameter optimization, time taken to train these models becomes an issue. To tackle this issue the package makes use of the joblib library for parallelization. With the help of joblib, the various base models are trained in parallel, also the predictions on the cross validation data are obtained by running the predict functions in parallel. For the ensemble models the training of the different ensemble models are done in parallel, so is the testing phase of the ensemble models. This has enabled for a fast, robust, well defined package with immense potential in the world of machine laeenring.The package is still in its primary stage, and will continue to be worked upon. Some of the key areas to work on will be adding more base models as well as different ensembling techniques and also expanding to regression, multi class classification and more.Creating better models is the critical component of building a good data science product.","Basic knowledge on machine learning and usage of python libraries like sklearn, pandas.",Ensemble Package (Link)https//github.com/unnati-xyz/ensemble-package,"A tech enthusiast and an optimist, pursuing his Bachelors in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the National Institute Of Technology, Karnataka.

If so, get ready to fill your applications with all sort of widgets, colors and animations.This talk is all about getting you ready to build graphical applications using GTK+ one amongst the finest multi-platform development kit for creating graphical user interfaces. The main focus of the talk will be on using PyGObject (not to be confused with PyGtk; the old stuff) with in between insights into graphical programming in general including topics such as X Windows Selections, Client side decorations (CSD), etc.If the names above just did not make any sense to you, do not worry. The talk will include everything from the very basic. While this talk won't be able to teach you everything, it will throw light on the trending technologies and help you avoid the obsolete.If you feel why GTK and not QT or TkInter, the answer is not so simple. While GTK+ is developed by the GNOME foundation and has great support for Linux, QT seems to be a more popular choice since its applications can be ported to far varied platforms than GTK. What I find compelling about GTK+ is that ""A chair() is still a chair()"". What I mean is that the GTK+ API comes very naturally to a beginner without having to remember special names. The very name of the classes and their inheritance model is easily understandable.If you follow the link to sample programs under ""Content urls"", you will find the codes there really simple and generic. But the talk won't be a held back, I plan to go full fledged with building an application from ground up as and when we discuss  the various topics so that you can see what it means to code in python; for if it ain't swift, it ain't python.",A general understanding of python syntax is good enough.,To gauge the basic terminology go through http//www.gtk.org/ AND  http//www.gtk.org/features.php.API Python GTK+ tutorials https//python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Sample programs https//github.com/A-star-ayush/PyGobject,"Way into the third year of my Computer Science and Engineering, I have always loved to code.

Ever since, I have enjoyed the thrill in messing around with the interface, applying the tiniest tweaks and checking out the work of others on the internet.

Python's dynamic nature allows typos in variable/ attribute names, and incorrect indentation to go unnoticed, until aspecific input drives it through the erroneous code path. Integrationtesting be it manual or automated is insufficient and can at timesbe frustating for Python code.Fortunately Python's own standard library makes it easy to write unittest cases, by providing the needed infrastructure. Through thisworkshop we would like to make a strong case for unit testing, andthen show how to use the available frameworks for writing testcases.

A few of them will be changing the neural network itself, which others will focus more on using tools to enhance performance. I have ran very deep neural networks in real-time on CPUs using some of the techniques which will presented.

I have personally achieved accuracies of above 90% using Deep Neural Networks when there are only a few hundreds of images available as training data. I'll be sharing some of those intuitions in this talk, including concepts like initialization, normalization, tweaking the learning rate, regularization, when to finetune and when not to etc. The whole talk will be focused on using Python to run Deep Neural Networks using the Theano/Keras library, which is the most popular deep learning library and is used widely by amateurs and professionals alike.

While a naive search bar that simplified information extraction and delivery of web pages was the rage in early 2000s, exponential increase in data and information on the Internet is making it natural for the search bar to evolve into a smarter and responsive interface. Not only can this search bar be more responsive in terms of guiding users in an iterative aka conversation based search, but it can also be assistive in fetching information that suits the interests of different users. Sooner or later, such conversational interface will replace the old-generation search bar.However, building such conversational interface has several technology challenges a) the interface has to understand and extract intent from natural human inputs in terms of text or speech (this is partly done by the current generation search interfaces), b) it has to generate meaningful dialogue responses to engage users into a conversation, c) it has to understand and use context to assist users in fetching the most relevant information, and while doing so d) make the information results personalized to the user as she uses the interface over time.How do we solve these technology challenges? Is the ‘conversational search’ a hype or soon to be reality? How are recent advances in deep learning playing their role towards building such ‘chat bots’? How can we build a real interactive search interface using existing web (or Django) and machine learning frameworks. In this talk, I will take a deep dive to answer these questions and present the state of the art in building conversational agents during Django and Tensorflow (and Python, of course!). Tensorflow is a machine/deep learning package (using Python) open sourced by Google and has several advanced features to parse user text queries and personalize search results.Specifically, I will talk about building Django-based rest frameworks without and with websockets to enable interactive text search interfaces. Such interfaces are expected to become pervasive in coming years to replace web search bar, e-commerce search bars or any domain specific search engines such as education, healthcare etc. I will talk about implementation details of API using Django to enable such interface. The talk will also give an overview of the current state of deep learning techniques to build a chat bot, and provide details a few techniques such as LSTM or sequence to sequence learning in building a chat bot in reality.",Django 1.9TensorFlow 0.9Python 3.4Rest frameworksWebsocketsDjango channelsSome familiarity wit Machine Learning or Deep Learning,Link to the presentation https//www.dropbox.com/s/1egi7ccwk1bu5de/chat-bots-pycon.pdf?dl=0,"Vijay Gabale is co-founder and CTO of Infilect, an AI-powered Commerce Platform.

So lets SWAGGERize our API's and learn how to implement Swagger with Python as well as other Language based REST APIs.The talk will first focus on drawing a parallel between the SOA implementations like CORBA or .net webservices/remoting and REST API's and why everyone moved from complex implementations to simplistic REST API implementation and how the tenets of SOA were shaken during this process.

It looks at the collection of items they have liked and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. Two flavours of this are item-based filtering and user-based filtering. The differences between these two can be expressed as-  1. “Users who liked this item also liked...”- Item-based Collaborative Filtering                                                                                                                                    2. “Users similar to you also liked...”- User-based Collaborative FilteringA comprehensive open-source package in Python for Collaborative Filtering does not exist.This package, CollabFilter is our contribution to developing a recommendation system in Python.

They get to know how they can write a service and monitor builds and trigger builds in Jenkins.Audience also get to learn the basics of CI and the insight that Python can be used to write a scalable codereviewing system. Parts of Talk1. Introduction to Pagure2. Introduction to CI3. Introduction to Jenkins4. Introduction to Fedmsg5. The need for the plugin6. Architecture of the service to interact with JenkinsIntroduction to PagurePagure is a light-weight git-centered forge based on pygit2.Currently, Pagure offers a decent web-interface for git repositories, a simplistic ticket system (that needs improvements) and possibilities to create new projects, fork existing ones and create/merge pull-requests across or within projects. Few examples areTravis CI, Jenkins etcIntroduction to CICI or Continuous integration is a practice which actually helps the developers to test their features with respect to integratingit with the project. It actually tells the developers if the changes the made to the code base is stable or not. Introduction to jenkinsJenkins is an integration management system (CI) used by most of the apps in fedora for automated testing and integration. Introduction to Fedmsgfedmsg (Fedora-Messaging) is a python package and API used around Fedora Infrastructure to send and receive messages to and from applications.Need for the pluginThe need arose when a pull request to Pagure is merged and it cause the build to fail. We need to find out which pull request cause the build to fail. The whole gist is to attach a build report to each pull request so that we know the status of the Jenkins build looking at the pull request.ArchitectureJenkins service act as the intermediate node between the ""pull request"" and the ""Jenkins"". Now whenever a pull request is merged it informs the Jenkins service. Now the build is being monitored continuously to find out the build status.

In his post, Samuele showed that the Python 2.2 method resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 method resolution order. Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now Python 2.3 uses C3.Hence, Python uses two algorithms for method resolution order. The Old MRO algorithm is very straight forward but the new one is not so easy to bring out. I will be discussing and explaining both the algorithm and I would also be talking a a bit about the background of this change and the benefits of new C3 Method Resolution Order.Talk OutlineThe Problem (Why we need MRO)Solution  (The two Algorithms)Old classes and New classesThe old MRO AlgorithmInconsistency with Old MROExamples of finding MRO using old algorithmLinearization of a Class (some terms for new algorithm)C3 Method Resolution Order (The New MRO)The new MRO AlgorithmExamples of working of new MRO algorithmWhy its better?Concluding notes","There are no prerequisites for this talk, anyone who can write a class in python and have a basic idea of inheritance can easily follow this talk.",[1] Slides http//slides.com/aktech/python-mro/[2] Python MRO documentation https//www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/[3] Samuele Pedroni's Mail https//mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-October/029035.html,"Amit Kumar is a Core Developer at SymPy.

The focus now, is on building inexpensive and intelligent robots that can think on their own. And as they grow more complex, robotic systems are becoming increasingly concurrent. With massive development efforts being undertaken all over the world in robotics, there is a need to have a common framework that allows code and hardware sharing and is scalable to allow numerous concurrent processes.Robot Operating System (ROS) is one such framework, that is the de facto standard for robotics software development across the world. It is successfully being used in industry, academia and personal projects to allow robots to talk to each other and work collectively. ROS is open source and language independent, with Python and C++ being its most popular implementations. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers. If you want to be part of the ongoing robotics revolution,  learning ROS will let you choose from the affordable TurtleBot, the capable and friendly Baxter , or even NASA’s Robonaut, currently undergoing testing on the International Space Station.

Can I create recommendations purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search? How do I use natural language processing techniques to create valid recommendations?This talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state-of-the-art technique - word2vec. We will create something that not only matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative recommendations. The beauty of such a framework is that not only does it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in user tone and behavior.The trick/secret sauce is - How do we account for the 'context' and build it in our systems? The talk will answer these questions and showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.MOTIVATIONS &amp; PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSThe current recommender systems tend to misfire when user history is not known or new products are introduced into the mix.

Engineers normally need to keep rising, lathering and repeating these steps to get a workable product out. The point of this talk is that some of these stages are very repetitive and can be automated.In general, data-driven projects have a lot to benefit from the kind of work that normally devops and build engineers do. Specifically, I will be taking some examples and demonstrating in detail how CI tools can be invaluable in iterating through the development cycle of a machine learning project. Continuous integration, in this case, can be thought of as simply something that runs a predefined script regularly, or is triggered by an external event. Indeed, this is useful (and popular) in building and testing, but the flexibility of a CI system can be leveraged to accomplish arbitrary tasks.In part, this talk is also about culture and habits. I will be speaking in detail about what data scientists can learn from build and devops engineers - and how adopting even the most common CI practices can be extremely rewarding for a data scientist.

This talk shows how deep learning was used to generate music.Deep learning attempts to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers whereas the traditional Machine learning algorithms emphasizes on what work the computer program must do after it is given a data set. The basic idea in deep learning is  to perform an unsupervised learning procedure on every single layer in addition to using gradient descent for the network as a whole. The goal of the unsupervised learning is to make each single layer extract characteristic features out of its input that can be used by subsequent layers.

Extraction of important topical words and phrases from documents, commonly known as terminology extraction or automatic keyphrase extraction is a hot topic in the research field. It comes under one of the crucial tasks in natural language processing for purposes of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured (text) datasets.Keyphrases provide a concise description of a document’s content; they are useful for document search, clustering, categorization, and summarization; help in building a content based recommendation system as you can quantify semantic similarity with other documents. Since we are producing raw data now more than ever, clustering and contextualizing data becomes a more difficult task. With the help of Python and specifically NLTK it becomes a tad bit easier. My talk will provide information regarding methodology, keyphrase selection (unsupervised and supervised methods), algorithms which help us quantify weights relative to document corpus followed by a step wise guidance on building a decent keyphrase extraction system using NLTK in Python.

Token based Authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token),UltimateCoder (~ultimatecoder),"22 Jun, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/token-based-authentication-system-using-jwt-json-web-token~aKQzd/,Intermediate,Talks,Web Development,"31 Aug 2016, 09:59",3,"JSON Web TokenDefinitionJWT is standard for making authentication token. JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and encrypted.JSON Web Token as Token Based Authentication systemUnlike session based authentication, Token based authentication system takes very less load of server. In session based authentication system, maintaining of session storage is requires processing and storage. While as Token based authentication system, it is not required to maintain session storage at server side. Tone of processing and storage will be saved. Beauty of using JWT as authentication token is it's simplicity. Once token is created, it is possible to authenticate user without touching the database again. Token can be discarded when it is expired by time from the expire time mentioned in token itself. The JWT is self contained token which has authentication, expire time information and any other user defined claims digitally signed. UsageJWT can be used to provide Token Based Authentication system at your ReST API. Because JWT is self contained with required claims it is possible to scale API without depending on Authentication server.

Using JWT is simple and more efficient when we have to design authentication system for our internal client who are not user of any Oauth provider like Gmail, Facebook etc. OAuth 2.0 contains many payload values which increase token size and it requires time to transfer where as using JWT, it is possible to get small size token with best security as Oauth 2.0Slide OutlineToken Based Authentication system using JWTBy Jaysinh ShuklaSpeaker DescriptionRole Full stack developerGithub1 http//github.com/ultimatecoder2 http//github.com/jsh-odooTwitter @jaysinhpEmail jaysinhp@gmail.comIRC thebigjTypes of AuthenticationSession / Cookie AuthenticationToken AuthenticationSession Authentication for Multiple UserSession or Cookie AuthenticationClient sends authentication credentials (username and password) to Server.Server verifies authentication credentialsif valid, assigns session storage, creates session id and returns  session id to requested client.Client stores session id probably at Cookie storage. This id  is sent by client with every request. And from that session id user is  identified further.This allows to identified the same user from upcoming request without  re asking user credentials.Disadvantages of Session AuthenticationDifficult to handle with  Load balancerRequired high amount of resource(RAM without mass-storage) for maintaining  huge amount of user session parallel.CORS  doesn't work well with cookiesBirth of Token AuthenticationToken based authentication are most popular authentication system for APIs.Comparatively puts less load than Session authentication.Best forScalingLoad balancerNo cookie, No CSRF  protection.Same API, Authentication will be used for Mobile and Front end app.Algorithm of Token AuthenticationClient sends authentication credentials.Authentication credentials are verified by server. If valid Token is  crated.Token is logged to database and the token is sent back as  authentication tokenThe client sends Token with every request to get verified.Normally token is generated with random value and hashed with popular  hashing algorithm.Revoking access of specific Token by deactivating record at token  table.How Token Authentication works normallyExample of authentication at Djnago Rest Frameworkfrom rest_framework.authtoken.models import Tokentoken = Token.objects.create(user=...)print token.keyAbove code is used at authentication view where that token.key is returnedif credentials are right.Assuming random output 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4bExample of Client request using curlcurl -X GET http//127.0.0.18000/api/example/ -H 'Authorization Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b'Example of Token Authentication at Django Rest Framework@python_2_unicode_compatibleclass Token(models.Model)    """"""    The default authorization token model.
